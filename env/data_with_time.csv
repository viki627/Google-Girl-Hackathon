5,7314004,Suicide Or Something Else: Are The World‚Äôs Bankers In Danger?,http://topinfopost.com/2014/02/27/suicide-or-something-else-are-the-worlds-bankers-in-danger,2014,"It started off with one of the world‚Äôs bankers committing suicide, and now the number is up to nine. Are there hidden problems in the banking world that the public does not yet know about?The Suicides BeginThe first two bankers went quietly, one jumping to his death after confirming that he would be home in time for dinner, and the next international banker simply hung himself in his home. While the two suicides did occur in an extremely short period of time, it is by no means unheard of for stressed bankers to suddenly leap to their deaths.And then the third suicide happened. This time the bank executive did not work at JP Morgan, instead it was a Deutsche Bank executive who followed their example. Speculation widened as a fourth investment banker apparently committed suicide, and this time the connections could not be ignored.This time the unfortunate banker was the chief economist for Russell Investments, Mike Dueker who was found dead of alongside a Washington State highway. What makes this suicide exceptional is that the out of shape banker suddenly became a world class athlete.The fifty year old banker chose to make a statement with his impressive jump over a 4 foot fence and then throw himself down a 50 foot embankment. It seems that simply jumping off a bridge or a building was not enough of a challenge.Fact Might Be Stranger Than FictionBy now experts are speculating and rumors are beginning to fly. Remember the banking fiasco in Greece? It seems that the petrol dollar may have had something to do with the country‚Äôs bailout. Underneath Greece‚Äôs national waters lies a vast reserve of oil and gas. Whoever saves the country gets a piece of the oil. Were the suicidal bankers on to something?They were conducted an investigation into certain international banking practices. Is someone getting nervous?Just when experts were beginning to believe that the suicides were simply one of the hazards of the job, a fifth international banker commits suicide.As the strange and tragic story continues to unfold, the link between the bankers becomes even more solid. Interviews with fellow employees and a long and extensive paper trail led investigators to realize that the recently deceased bankers not only knew each other, they were all working on similar international banking investigations. Hedge funds, oil, and possible gold market crashes are all being covered in the ongoing investigation.After the ridiculous apparent suicides, someone decided to get a little more creative. David Bird, who just happens to be the oil markets reporter for the Wall Street Journal has vanished. After 20 years of steady and informative investigative reporting, he simply disappeared and has not been seen or heard from since January 11th 2014.Coincidences are Getting Harder to IgnoreAs second death from the oil, gas, and solar sector came when the managing director of Tata Motors, who also happens to be part of the larger global empire of Cyrus P. Mistry power generation business. Karl Slym apparently decided to jump to his death from his high rise hotel room. No one knows why.As the suicides continue, all eyes are beginning to turn to the Danish market. The Danes are using the same hedge fund ploy as the Greeks did to supplement their lagging economy. Once again, billions of dollars of oil deposits are on the table and the same super powers are eyeballing the potential windfall for themselves.Did the bankers discover something?It would seem that the bankers may have been on to something. With the rapid succession of the next three suicides, the total was at an astonishing eight bankers dead by self-inflicted means. Was the market getting ready to crash?The death of the ninth banker has finally confirmed what many others already feared, there was a conspiracy going on. An anonymous source predicted that a prominent American banker would ‚Äúexpire‚Äù on February 5th 2014.Introducing the Mysterious ‚ÄúV‚ÄùA mysterious renegade economist, ‚ÄúV‚Äù has been steadily feeding tidbits of information concerning the bankers‚Äô deaths, and is helping to connect the dots. The bankers were being murdered and the death of American James Stuart, the former CEO of the National Bank of Commerce, confirms this.The deaths of the bankers are linked not only to Greece‚Äôs recent default on their loans that had used hedge funds as collateral, but with the super powers willing to let the Danish do the same thing, it means that the big guys will eventually control the newly discovered oil and all the profits.As the world watches, we will wait to see what happens in the global banking world. Will China, U.S. and the Central Banks continue to support what will probably turn into an economic disaster for the Danish people, or has the strange apparent suicides of the bankers put enough of a spotlight on the situation to save the Danish economy?Only time will tell if their deaths were in vain.¬© Copyright (c) The Top Information PostPutin Says He Has Proof Princess Diana Was Killed By British Royal FamilyProof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten InterviewThis New Cannabis Capsule Is So Powerful That It Could Replace All Pain KillersCelebrities React To Death Of ‚ÄòBrutal Dictator‚Äô Fidel CastroThis Teen Is Re-Creating Sculptures That Were Destroyed By ISISThis Harvard Professor Wants To Legalize All Drugs.

Ensuring you are targeting a willing, hungry and profitable audience is, without a doubt, the most important step of any marketing campaign. Getting this right upfront will save you hours of wasted time and effort.Robert Coorey, Director of Global Marketing at e-Web Marketing, used science to help him ensure there was an audience waiting for his new book Feed A Starving Crowd which shares 200 tips for finding hungry customers.Here‚Äôs how Rob ensured he would sell hundreds of copies of his book before he wrote a single word.Let me share the story of how I found a starving crowd of buyers for my new book using Amazon.I was recently reading up on self-publishing and I came across a book called APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur ‚Äì How to Publish a Book by Guy Kawasaki.I know and love Guy‚Äôs work but, before buying the book, I was enjoying checking out some of the reviews (don‚Äôt we all?)One of the reviews was very detailed and gave the book just three stars. The reviewer was critical that the book didn‚Äôt provide much help for unknown, first-time authors.Hot tip: In my opinion, three-star ratings are the best you can use for market research. Anyone who gives a one-star or a five-star rating is heavily biased. Maybe they are a fan of Guy (and would give anything he did 5 stars) or perhaps they have read every book out there and nothing would impress them anymore (leaving 1 star). Three-stars seems to be the sweet spot where the reviewer has considered the book, enjoyed some parts of it but has constructive criticism.Going back to through this and other reviewers‚Äô comments I had an ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù: launching a book for unknown authors is a huge concern and pain point. For anyone wanting to write a book from scratch and self-publish it there is so much to learn and to get right: authors want to learn how to sell the first 100 copies of their books coming from nothing. These authors have got no marketing budget but they do have plenty of time. They‚Äôre not scared to do menial tasks to get their books out there, they just want to see results.Best of all, they‚Äôre passionate about their books: each author thinks his or her book is the best thing anyone has ever written! Fair enough; it probably is. Selling information products to bootstrapping authors is definitely feeding a starving crowd.I used the above thought process (what I‚Äôm terming the ‚ÄúAmazon method‚Äù) to write my latest book, ‚ÄúFeed a Starving Crowd.‚ÄùFirstly, I looked at the top 100 marketing books on Amazon, and went through all of the 3 star reviews to find out what the common complaints were about each of these books. Here‚Äôs a few examples:Nothing particularly new here ‚Äì just a solid revision of accepted success principles.No specific information, all general advice, its already been said elsewhere.It takes forever to get to the point, too much waffle.Doesn‚Äôt help you if youre just starting out ‚Äì only good if you‚Äôre already established.Not a ‚Äúnuts and bolts‚Äù marketing book.No processes or steps to follow ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt show you the how.Most info can be found online for free.¬†‚Ä¶this got me thinking: what if I wrote a book that specifically addressed the concerns from these three star reviewers?When I began writing my ‚ÄúFeed A Starving Crowd‚Äù I made sure that the information I shared was brand new and that there were specific instructions and exact steps, no boring general advice. I made sure the book was concise and too the point, without any waffle and that the strategies I recommended were either free or very inexpensive to implement. Finally, I made sure that all of the tips could be used by one-man bands, small businesses and entrepreneurs ‚Ä¶ I wanted to make it clear that you didn‚Äôt need to be a massive big Fortune 500 company to use these tips.To show you what I mean, here is one of the tips from the book.In 2012, Professor Kathleen Milkman of Wharton University published a study in the Journal of Marketing where she and her colleagues studied over 7,000 New York Times posts and looked to see which ones were the ‚Äòmost viral‚Äô. They found that there was very strong correlation between content that was highly emotionally charged and the content that got shared the most. This is a concept known as ‚Äúthe integral effect‚Äù.In Professor Milkman‚Äôs study,she also found that positive photos and content are much more likely to go viral than negative content. This quality is called ‚Äúvalence‚Äù. Researchers in this study found that content that was positive or had positive valence and was charged, emotionally-loaded content, was extremely likely to go viral. This is why Memes and inspirational quotes always do well on Facebook.Rather than leave it there, I went further in the book and included a real-world example from a campaign I ran.Just a few months ago, we used Professor Milkman‚Äôs research to crack the code with our Punnky Facebook page. In the space of just a few days we managed to get over 100,000 likes and 22,000 shares.How did the Punky campaign go so viral? There are a few reasons:The image in this specific example (the snapshot above) is very different. It is a screenshot of the Notes app from an iPhone and appears to be a personal message. This naturally creates curiosity ‚Äì ‚ÄúI wonder what this personal message is?‚Äù, etc.Our posts satisfied the results of scientific study which revealed how to make a post go viral using the integral effect.By taking a scientific approach to finding content for my latest book I was able to use Amazon‚Äôs freely available review-library to put together a book that I knew was answering the cries for help from one of those who needed it most: the 3-star raters!As a result of this approach and actually putting together content that answered customers‚Äô feedback (sharing 200 tips like the one above) the early reviews for my book have been wonderful. So far we‚Äôve only received positive reviews (none of the mediocre stuff we were trying to avoid!) such as this great feedback from World-Renowned Motivational Speaker and Author, Brian Tracy:‚ÄúThis powerful, practical book is loaded with great ideas to help you sell more, faster and easier in any market.‚ÄùHow can you use publicly available information to find out what your audience likes and dislikes and distill this into your next blog post, webinar or eBook? It‚Äôs this market research that will let you truly ensure you be feeding a starving crowd when you release your next marketing campaign!Robert CooreyRobert Coorey is a #1 best-selling author and online marketer.

8,7339794,God is in the neurons,http://cristivlad.com/mirror-neurons-empathy/,2014,"Have you ever seen someone get hurt by falling, getting knocked down, or by cutting his finger when cooking something? You then probably felt the actual pain of that person or experienced a shiver in your spinal cord. What has actually happened within your body?When your eyes saw the incident, mirror neurons fired in your brain causing your body to try to replicate the sensation the other person felt. Why?For a better understanding.Since we humans live in social circles, our brains adapted throughout eons in ways to be compatible with the others around us. A human relationship requires attention and care from both sides.That‚Äôs why when engaging in a human connection or when observing other people around us, the mirror neurons are ready to fire whenever it‚Äôs necessary to create a better reasoning of the situation.Sinigaglia and Sparaci (2010) wrote in the Journal of Analytical Psychology that mirror neurons ‚Äúare a specific class of sensory motor neurons‚Äù primarily discovered in 1992 in the ventral pre-motor cortex of monkeys‚Äô brains.These neurons tend to become activated when someone executes motor acts (such as grabbing food, walking, dancing, etc.) and when a person observes the actions of others.The first time I found out about mirror neurons was when reading the book of Daniel Goleman called Emotional Intelligence. Daniel began by talking about alexithymics in the chapter dedicated to empathy.Alexithymic people are those with a mental condition where they cannot express their own feelings and they cannot understand the feelings of others. This is incompatible with long-lasting human relationships.A very recent study from Yale University which came out just a few days ago (November 4, 2013) talks about adaptive mirroring.How could a boxer, for example, whose losing opponent shows fatigue, mirror the same feelings? This is when the boxer needs to emotionally disconnect from his opponent.However, the boxer needs to mirror his opponent‚Äôs actions and intentions to be able to punch back. This is when he needs to connect with his opponent. That‚Äôs an example of adaptive mirroring and our ability to attach and detach emotionally from the ones with whom we engage in social connections.Here‚Äôs a very explicative video on mirror neurons:Conversely to alexithymia, empathy is the ability or the talent (as Goleman likes to say) to decipher the emotional data other people transmit through their tone of voice, body language, silence moments, facial gestures, and other nonverbal cues.In a study conducted by Nowicki and Duke in 1989, the researchers have tested 101 children to determine their empathy levels. The children who proved to have a certain skill to identify the non-verbal cues of others were the most popular in school and the most emotionally stable, even though their IQs were not the highest.So, to better understand mirror neurons, we need to understand empathy. To better understand empathy, we need to understand ourselves.If I introspect and I understand myself, then I will be better suited to recognize other people‚Äôs feelings and better help them when they‚Äôre in need.Kelly McGonigal who wrote The Willpower Instinct (another Amazon bestseller) claimed that bad habits and good habits have the same power of spreading.What does this mean?Take a look at a relatively closed social circle, such as a group of people who like to party. Most of them drink a lot, most of them like to spend a lot of money, and most of them like to do nothing. The group is empowering itself.Think that their mirror neurons are constantly firing when they are all together. Their bad habits, such as their drinking habit, will be enforced continuously. This is a vicious circle. The best way to survive is to get out of the circle.There were periods of my life when I did just as described above. I used to get out each weekend with the same people, in the same places, and doing the same things. Those were two or three full years of constantly building and enforcing bad habits. The worst part is that I perceived everything as normality.I couldn‚Äôt see things from other perspectives because the people around me were thinking and doing the same thing.I wanted to give you a scientific perspective on the fact that if you‚Äôre not having the best time of your life, you can consciously make a change.1. Observe the people around you. 
2. What are their habits? What do they like to do?
3. What are your habits? Can you see some similarities?
4. Your mirror neurons are constantly firing and enforcing the same habits and patterns.
5. Get out of the situation. Leave the group.As Dale Carnegie said that ‚ÄúThe best way to win an argument is to avoid it‚Äú, I say that if your social circle has a negative impact on you, then you should find or make other social circles.Really successful companies are built by really tight successful groups, of which all the members are extraordinary individuals.To succeed in life is to surround yourself with empowering people who can help you and who you can help to improve.Reciprocity is key.If you are surrounded by great people, your mirror neurons will fire and replicate the actions of those individuals. You‚Äôll end up or, better said, build up to be one of them. This is a positive social circle oriented towards success.I‚Äôm really sure that there is at least one person you know who keeps a positive mental attitude. That‚Äôs where you should start. Maybe he/she knows another positive person. Or maybe both of you are efficient in finding others to join the group. Figure it out.Few people have heard of mirror neurons. You are one of them. Now you can see how your social surrounding influences you.Have you ever thought that your friends can have such a great impact on you? Are they your true friends? Should they really be? Now that you are empowered to make a change, will you do it?Please let me know your thoughts in the comment sections below.Later Edit: Some folks suggest that there may have been too much controversy with respect mirror neurons. See another perspective here.Sources:Sinigaglia, C., & Sparaci, L. (2010). Emotions in action through the looking glass.

I got answers to many of my questions.. actually to my short poem which i composed ‚Äújourney‚Äù were in mention that i got the friends who had same character as mine.. but i came to know it the mirror activity which produces it‚Ä¶Thanks for sharing Anitha!It would be interesting if someone could study brain injured; lonely; and/or depressed people and see if they *lack* mirroring techniques, or if by being alone the situation creates it ‚Äì period!  The effects thereof; and how they in turn affect those around them would be interesting and possibly develop a new way to change/cure it!!Yolanda, I think that we can find an answer to your question if we dig a little deeper into research studies. I‚Äôm pretty sure that studies have been made on depressed people. Some of them may not be concluded, while some can. I dont think that injured persons lack mirror neurons because these mirror neurons are also involved in movement (as they are located in the pre-motor cortex), so the person would have to seriously be unable to observe and understand what other people are doing when they are moving (for example).This is not the case for depressive people. However, mirror neurons could be a good approach to treating such types of conditions. Take a look at this study and let me know what you think:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703289I am familiar with brain injuries, and stroke. I have developed instinctual self taught techniques that have reawakened and reconnected the left and right brain neuro paths but lack the scientific knowledge to name, or identify the process.
I would love to discuss this further and perhaps share more discoveries in regards to this experience and your findings.I suffered brain injury from a brain aneurysm and a stroke on the OR table during the procedure to coil the aneurysm.  I am an empath and I feel others pain almost as acutely as they feel pain.  that wasn‚Äôt damaged by the brain injury but I now suffer with severe depression and anxiety.  my brain doesn‚Äôt function quite as sharply as it once did but i‚Äôm grateful my ability to feel for others wasn‚Äôt damaged.If there is some way that I can help you Kathy, please just let me know! I‚Äôm really sorry about your suffering.Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *Comment Name * Email * Website

	DataSift, a company that provides developers and third parties with access to Twitter, Facebook and other social data sources, has raised $15.25 million in Series B funding led by Scale Venture Partners with Northgate Capital and Daher Capital participating. This brings DataSift‚Äôs funding to $30 million.For background, developers, businesses, media companies and organizations use DataSift to mine the Twitter fire hose of social data, as well as Facebook, YouTube, blogs, forums and online message boards. But what makes DataSift special is that it can sort through billions of social interactions then filter this social media data for demographic information, online influence and sentiment, either positive or negative.DataSift does not limit searches based on keywords and applies natural language processing to turn unstructured data into structured, digestible information. The company‚Äôs product allows companies of any size to define extremely complex filters, including location, gender, sentiment, language, and even influence based on Klout scores, to provide quick and very specific insight and analysis.Rob Bailey, CEO of DataSift, says that the company was all set on money, but had a lot of inbound interest from investors. He adds that revenue has been exploding, and growth has been ‚Äúamazing.‚Äù‚ÄúWe have the world‚Äôs best infrastructure in real-time, as well as historical processing of social data, and through our Series B funding, we now have the ability to take that infrastructure to the next level,‚Äù said Nick Halstead, Founder and CTO of DataSift in a release. ‚ÄúThe promise of the DataSift platform lies in enabling our customers to bring together their private and public data and applying our powerful processing to that unstructured data. The ultimate goal of Big Data is drawing actionable insights from a combination of public and private data.‚ÄùThe company says it now has almost 300 corporate customers, up from 200 just a quarter ago, across a wide variety of markets, including Fortune 500 and social technology companies, news organizations, consulting companies, and government agencies.DataSift also recently debuted a number of new services to allow businesses to more easily integrate and analyze Social Data alongside their own business data. This service works with BI applications, databases, data warehousing platforms and other cloud services, including Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, MongoDB, CouchDB, FTP/SFTP, ElasticSearch and WebHooks.To understand the scale of DataSift‚Äôs processing, the startup deals with 700 million data interactions a day with over 20,000 data streams. Currently, DataSift processes 2 to 3 terabytes of data a day, and the company says that the volume of data passing through the platform has tripled over the past year.The new funding will be used to be expand infrastructure for managing data sources, as well as to launch new data sources. Bailey says that more companies want new sophisticated monitoring functions, and DataSift will be working on building out its platform. The company will also be scaling internationally and doubling down on hiring for sales, marketing and customer service.Latest headlines delivered to you daily"

Share the Spinnakr Blog with your friends!Buffer is one of the best tools out there for making it dead simple to automatically share content over social networks like Twitter. We use them, love them, and so do many of our colleagues and friends.Buffer also supports social media analytics that allow you to see who‚Äôs clicking and sharing your content. They called it ‚Äúthe missing link [that allows a user to see] whether your finding of content and sharing it actually has any impact.‚ÄùBut there‚Äôs a huge problem in how Buffer tracks clicks that makes its stats inaccurate and unreliable ‚Äì sometimes making it falsely appear as if content is ten times more popular than it is! Let me explain:When you share links over Twitter, the long URL get shortened by a service (Buffer uses bitly) and appears in a shortened code. This allows it to fit into 140 characters and also to track visitor analytics:When a Twitter visitor clicks that shortened link, her browser sends a request to the bitly web server ‚Äì bitly counts the hit, records the time, and then redirects to the real website. In this way, all the people who click your links are tracked by bitly, who then reports the data back to applications like Buffer for social media bees to figure out which content they‚Äôre sharing has the most impact.But since there are more websites out there than six digit codes, bitly does its best to conserve codes. If you‚Äôre not signed into an account, bitly will use a single ‚Äúglobal code‚Äù and share analytics with a bunch of other users. Even if you do sign in, bitly will give you one shortened code per account.The problem is that Buffer is only one bitly account, but is shortening links on behalf of a ton of users. So if another Buffer user and you both shorten the same link, you‚Äôll share the same code and the same stats.As a result, the default state of Buffer analytics becomes seriously screwed up. Take this post from @contribby that reports 17 potential views but 323 clicks!The tweet was posted just now but bitly will tell you that all the clicks happened back when the SETI institute tweeted the link.The original buffer tweet that ended up sharing stats with Contribby.The tough part about this bug is that it‚Äôs virtually impossible to track and threatens the integrity of the service as a whole. If you are a casual user of the service, you would be led to assume that some of your posts were wildly popular when they were really just shared by other Buffer users. As a result, you‚Äôd be encouraged to post tons of content about something that your Twitter readers didn‚Äôt even care about.Even worse, since the biggest value of Buffer is how it increases clicks by optimizing when your posts are released, it becomes very scary to dramatically over-report clicks, since it‚Äôs making your users believe your service is working better than it actually is (especially since the service is genuinely very effective).Fortunately, in the newest version of Buffer analytics you can connect to your own Bitly account (if you have one). Go to Settings and click the Connect Bitly link. That way your stats will all be linked to that account, versus Buffer‚Äôs.How to fix Buffer‚Äôs click analytics.It was awesome to see that change made in their latest version of their analytics, along with a note that seems to be referencing the bug:One quick note to make your analytics even more accurate. If you want to have click data be 100% personalized for each link, make sure to connect your own bit.ly account under ‚Äúsettings‚Äú. The best part about this is that you can always also login to your bit.ly account and get more information from there.Since tons of users will never realize the need to set that up or read the note above, Buffer should really deactivate the click reporting until they do. Otherwise, the click data is simply not reliable.Hopefully a change like this is on their list of things to do. And in the meantime, please share this post with other Buffer users so they know how to keep their stats accurate :-).Thanks for the post. I was searching for an answer as to why my tweets had so many clicks ‚Äî I would love it if it were true, but there‚Äôs just no way ‚Äî and you helped me solve my issue.Just wanted to say thanks,
GregIs there any way you can extrapolate any data from those numbers? For instance, I shortened a link through bit.ly of our annual report for an email blast to our stakeholders. The total clicks is 13,391 which is impossible. But the email was sent on September 30. Can I ‚Äúassume‚Äù that number is closer to the truth? Or is there another way to extrapolate data?¬© 2012, SpinnakrOur Google+ page"
15,4600576,The Whole Brain Billiards Biohacking Project,http://www.billiardsbiohacker.com/brainhack/,2012,"Okay, so I finally set the date for the launch of my brain hacking project.My brain training will begin on 10/10/12.¬† I am committing to 6 months of intensive whole brain training to see if I can improve cognitive performance (raise my IQ, improve short-term memory & spatial intelligence), improve my health (20 specific biomarkers, sleep quality & heart rate variability) and make quantum leaps in my sports performance (accuracy, focus & endurance).I‚Äôm going to share all of my findings on this site and on The Billiards Biohacker Report Podcast, so anyone can follow along and, hopefully, gain insights to improve their own health and performance.What I Will Be DoingI will be following a specific whole brain training protocol. ¬†This brain training is designed to ‚Äúexercise‚Äù and increase the usage of both hemispheres of my brain. ¬†Also, they will increase the ‚Äúprocessing speed‚Äù of my brain by increasing myelination and growing neuron pathways in the brain. ¬† I will be performing the following daily training drills.I‚Äôm trying to be coached by an experienced brain training coach that has worked with professional golfers, tennis players and baseball players.How I Will Measure, Track and Report ResultsI will be tracking and reporting metrics in 3 key areas: ¬†Health, Cognitive Performance and Billiards Performance
1. ¬†Health MetricsI will be looking at health from a few different angles.First, I will be tracking key biometric markers through blood testing. ¬†At a minimum, I will be doing baseline testing before the start of the project and testing at the completion. ¬†If I have enough funding, I will do testing at the mid-point, too. ¬†If the project is fully funded, I will be using the services of¬†www.InsideTracker.com.¬† They have a very comprehensive set of 20 critical performance biomarker tests that they run.Here is a list of the 20 biomarkers.Strength and EnduranceEnergy and MetabolismBone and Muscle HealthBrain and BodyPerformanceA couple of other health markers that I want to track.Heart Coherence:
I will track my heart rate variability and my ability to get into coherence with my Emwave 2 device.Sleep Quality:
Part of the funding of this project will go towards the purchase of a Zeo Sleep Monitoring Device. ¬†I want to see if there is a correlation between quality of sleep and brain function. ¬†Also, I want to see if these exercises have an impact on the amount of REM & deep sleep that I experience.2. ¬†Cognitive PerformanceDual N-Back Scoring: ¬†I will be performing Dual N-Back tasks via software that will score my working memory and fluid intelligence. ¬†I will perform these tasks, before the start of my training, to get a baseline. ¬†I will perform the same tasks at multiple points, throughout the duration of the experiment to compare performance.3. ¬†Billiards Performance
I will be repeating a set of pool playing drills that will test my accuracy, spatial intelligence and focus. ¬†I will do this set of drills before my brain training begins to get a baseline score. ¬†I will perform the same set of drills at intervals throughout the 6 month training program and log my results. ¬†I will be watching to see if the intense hand-eye-body coordination drills and ambidextrous fine motor skills training will translate to better performance with my pool stroke and with my minds ability to perform visual-spatial processing.
I will be looking for¬†correlations in the data collected above.Also, I will be reporting other anecdotal findings along the way.¬† I will be sharing all of my data, findings and experiences on my blog and weekly podcast.I‚Äôll be sharing videos, so people can see the types of exercises that I‚Äôm doing. ¬†I‚Äôll be sharing some extra videos that I will make available to folks who are able to help fund the project with a donation of $10 or more. ¬†In these ‚Äúsecret access‚Äù videos, I will be sharing all of the best discoveries that I find with regard to improving my game during this project.Can You Help Me Out?
If you think you may be interested in helping me fund this little project of mine, just follow this link to my project home page.¬† Even if you don‚Äôt contribute money, you can still participate by asking any questions you may have or give me some comments.
¬†What‚Äôs In It For YouThese types of quanitified-self experiments can be as good for the observer as they are for the experimenter. ¬†My published results will help a lot of people understand the impact of brain exercising.¬† This is something that is under-appreciated and desperately needed in our modern-day lifestyle. ¬†These types of physical and mental exercises can really help to improve performance and prevent mental degeneration.The impact of passive stress on our bodies and mind is huge. ¬†The type of training I will be doing is a great form of¬†active¬†stress that helps to strengthen the brain and improve overall health in ways that can be¬†trans-formative.
You can play a part in getting this information out to a lot of people. ¬†Also, you can gain from it yourself by implementing the stuff that I find that works and avoid the stuff that I find not working.Lastly, I‚Äôm giving some cool rewards for being a contributor.Check out my rewards list and get the most from your generous contributions. ¬†Here are some highlights from the Rewards Levels.Secret Access Videos: ¬†
I will be providing a special part of this site that will hold videos reserved for anyone funding $10 or more. ¬†I will save my best tips, insights and knowledge gained for these videos. ¬†If you fund $10 or more, I will send you the secret link to view those videos throughout the 6 month experiment.
Special DVD:
For a donation of $20 or more, I will create and send a special DVD.¬† After the project is complete, I will produce a DVD that will explain how you could use the same types of brain training techniques. ¬†I will utilize my learnings from the 6 months of intensive training to share with you what works and what doesn‚Äôt.
This DVD will teach you how to apply brain training to improve your health, brain function and sports performance. ¬†Of course, the sports performance will have information specific to the sport of billiards. ¬†Though, I‚Äôm sure that this information could be applied in many other disciplines with similar physical & mental demands.Brain Training and/or Billiards Coaching
I have a rewards package for $75 that includes the DVD, Secret Access Videos and a 1 hour consultation with me (no travel included). ¬†I will help you however I can with that hour time-period. ¬†If you are local, I can do a face-to-face meeting. ¬†If it is long-distance, I can consult with you over phone and/or Skype. ¬†I can review video footage, too. ¬†Bottom line, I‚Äôll do whatever I can to help you advance your game, health or cognitive skills. ¬†I really believe that I‚Äôm going to gain a lot of insight into how brain training can improve pool skills. ¬†This is based on results I‚Äôve seen with golfers, tennis players and baseball players.Website and Podcast Sponsoring
I have a few slots available to promote your product or service on this site, TubeBilliards.com (1200 uniques/month, 4000 page views/month, 7min./visit) and The Billiards Biohacker Report Podcast. ¬†I will do my best to represent your brand in a very¬†professional¬†manner if you decide to choose one of these rewards. ¬†I tried to create a good value with these sponsorship programs. ¬†You could really benefit as this site keeps growing as I think it will. ¬†Also, you can change the ad, throughout the year, if you want to promote another product or ad design. ¬†Anyone that chooses one of the sponsorship rewards, will also receive the DVD and Secret Video access, too.Billiards Artwork Collection
By fueling my project with $900, you can own my limited edition Movie Set Series Artwork Collection by Linda Pault. ¬† This is the complete set of 6 different high-quality prints. ¬†She sells these on her website for $400 each, so this is a $2,400 value. ¬†One of them is already framed, which is another included value. ¬†They are hand-signed and numbered lithographs in excellent condition. ¬†They would be a great edition to any home billiards room or pool hall.How The Funds Will Be UsedI want to do this project the right way. ¬†In order to do that, I will need help to cover some of the costs. ¬†All of the expenses add up to $1,900. ¬†Here is the cost breakdown.$950 ‚Äì ¬†6 months of Brain Training Coaching and Training Materials
The biggest expense with this experiment is the services of a proven brain coach. ¬†I wanted to make sure that I am being taught the most cutting-edge techniques in whole brain training.$499 ‚Äì ¬†Blood Testing of 20 Health Biomarkers from¬†InsideTracker.com
This is the most comprehensive set of biomarkers designed to track energy, metabolism, strength, endurance, muscle health, brain health and performance.
$160 ‚Äì¬†Zeo Bedside Sleep Manager
I need to purchase this device, so I can track the quality of my sleep. ¬†It will track how much REM & deep sleep and how often I wake at night. ¬†All data that is used to calculate quality of sleep. ¬†It will give an overall sleep quality number that will make it very easy to show a trend in sleep quality.$100 ‚Äì Rewards Expenses
This will be used to create DVDs, ship DVDs and artwork.$190 ‚Äì RocketHub‚Äôs CutFunding Notes:
If I fall short of my funding goal, I‚Äôm still going to do as much of the experiment as I can. ¬†I really hope to be able to use the brain training coach, though, in some capacity. ¬†If I‚Äôm close to my funding goal, I will cut-back on the blood testing expenses, by going with a smaller group of biomarkers or using testing that is covered by my medical insurance.
If I go over my funding goal, I will use the extra funds for an extra set of blood tests at the mid-point of the experiment.
No matter what, I will continue to use any funds to do as much to quantify and share my results to help as many people as I can.Why I‚Äôm Doing ThisIf you aren‚Äôt familiar with the concept of biohacking, it has been defined as ‚Äúusing systems thinking, science, biology and self-experimentation to take control of and upgrade your body, your mind and your life.‚Äù ¬†Simply put, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to upgrade my performance in life, in my career and in billiards.I‚Äôve been playing pool for over 35 years. ¬†Now that I am 43 years old, I feel my cognitive abilities, energy and focus declining, as many people have. ¬†It is my belief that this does not have to be the case. ¬†I want to use this brain training protocol to see if I can take my health and billiards performance to a level that far exceeds any level that I‚Äôve experienced, even in my ‚Äúprime‚Äù years decades ago.Like many sports enthusiasts, I have a very demanding career, so I don‚Äôt have the luxury to spend lots of time practicing. ¬†Yet, I want to improve.Many players (weekend warriors), want to keep improving, but struggle because of a lack of time to practice and prepare. ¬†I hope to show them (and full-time sports professionals) that there is different way to approach health, performance and aging.
That being said, I hope you will choose to help fund my brain hacking experiment. ¬†It should be a fun experiment and an educational one, too.Cheers,
Skippy[‚Ä¶] structuring the project, along with metrics that I will be using to quantify and report my results. All of this is explained in great detail in the recent article I wrote.

16,4809144,Health Benefits of Alternative Seating,http://feelgoodtime.net/health-benefits-of-alternative-seating/,2012,"Your Daily Medicine And Healthy PregnancySitting, even for short periods of time, can be damaging to the body in many ways, due to the unnatural position most people find themselves in. When a job requires sitting in a chair for hours at a time, or a disabling condition requires a person to sit for extended times, the neck, spine, hips, and joints can become irritated and misaligned, causing aches and pain. Over time, this can lead to deteriorating of the cartilage between bones, poor posture, weight gain, and a lifetime dealing with symptoms that can include headaches, neck and back stiffness, arthritis in the joints, and even heart and lung disease.That‚Äôs why many wellness experts recommend alternative seating options to help reduce and prevent these ailments. These can be implementing ergonomic chairs, desks, footrests, and keyboards, or they may include the use of ‚Äúsoft seating‚Äù areas for rests in between intense work periods. Some may also include exercise balls, kneeling benches, standing desks or walk-up work stations that are becoming more popular with workplaces. These are just a handful of the alternative seating options available today.There are several health benefits of alternative seating to consider, some that can be accomplished merely by adjusting to more ergonomic chairs or using an appropriate work station for each task. Here are the potential benefits of alternative seating.When switching out older office chairs, work stations and equipment to provide a more healthful environment, you‚Äôll start to notice less pain your spine and neck in just a few days. The¬†Mayo Clinic¬†also recommends doing seated back stretches for optimum spinal health. It is interesting that proper seating may also help in hiccups causes.Believe it or not, but your choice of seating can affect more than just your back and neck. Poor posture from a badly designed chair can cause headaches from stress on the body. A recent¬†health article¬†talks about the effect of poor seating on blood vessels which lead to headaches and feelings of stress.When people have alternative seating options, they are less likely to stay in one position all day. Instead, they are free to move to other work stations, change positions, and put less strain on tired or weak muscles. This can improve physical well-being by encouraging walking, stretching, and the use of other body muscle groups.When changing from traditional office chairs to alternative seating, many consumers have found a positive side-effect: weight loss. A¬†NY Times report¬†proved that weight loss, specifically the kind that deals with the waistline, can result from the use of exercise balls instead of chairs in the office.You may think that having the option to use alternative seating is just for physical well-being, but did you know that alternative seats can also improve mental leaning and behavior? A¬†Pediatric Physical Therapy¬†study conducted in 2006 indicated that when a group of children diagnosed with ADHD were given alternative seating instead of school chairs they paid better attention and scored higher in classroom tests (also, check avoidant personality disorder test and the causes of gamophobia).While the overall benefits of alternative seating remain to be studied on a larger scale, the facts show that having access to other types of seating have positive effects on humans of all ages. Consider how you can add alternative seating to your work area and office to experience the healthful benefits of this too.Your email address will not be published.

21,944017,Minneapolis Criminal Lawyer: Myth-Busting Hollywood‚Äôs Legal Thrillers,http://www.kanslaw.com/blog/minneapolis-criminal-lawyer-myth-busting-hollywoods-legal-thrillers.html,2009,"¬†Myth-Busting Hollywood‚Äôs Legal Thrillers: Double Jeopardy Edition¬†Most of us are familiar with the Double Jeopardy clause ‚Äì probably not because we‚Äôve recently sat down with the Bill of Rights, but probably because we remember a 1999 Ashley Judd movie by that title, in which a woman (Libby) was framed for her husband‚Äôs murder, and because she had already been tried, sentenced and served time in prison for the crime, she couldn‚Äôt be re-prosecuted for finding and actually killing him thereafter.¬†As usual, Hollywood wasn‚Äôt as concerned with providing accurate information as it was with making and marketing a blockbuster thriller.¬† So, here‚Äôs a quick Myth Busters breakdown of the movie versus the law in Minnesota.Premise: In the movie, one of Libby‚Äôs fellow prisoners tells her about the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and how since the state already thinks she killed her husband, she can walk up to him in a public place, in the middle of the day, and shoot him with tons of witnesses around and she can‚Äôt be charged or convicted for the crime.¬†Legal Fact: Double Jeopardy does come from the Fifth Amendment, and reads: ‚Äú‚Äù[no person shall] be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb‚Äù.¬† The purpose behind it was to prevent prosecutorial harassment of defendants who were acquitted for a crime and to help uphold the right to a speedy trial by not clogging the court systems with cases that had already been tried.¬† The Fifth Amendment initially only applied to federal court cases, but through the doctrine of incorporation contained in the Fourteenth Amendment, it now applies in all state court cases as well, according to a famous US Supreme Court Case entitled Benton v. Maryland.¬†There are actually three types of protection offered by the Double Jeopardy clause: First, an individual cannot be retried for the same crime after an acquittal; second, an individual cannot be retried for the same crime after a conviction; and third, an individual cannot be punished twice for the same crime.¬† This last protection was discussed in a Minnesota Appellate Court decision issued this last September, in which the defendant appealed a sentence and the court found that he could not be punished for both the main offense and for a lesser included offense that arose out of the same behavioral incident.¬† You can read that court opinion at:http://www.lawlibrary.state.mn.us/archive/ctapun/0909/opa081177-0901.pdfDouble Jeopardy is sometimes considered a legal technicality, because it is an absolute defense that doesn‚Äôt address whether the defendant committed the alleged crime or not.¬† There is a great US Supreme Court case entitled Fong Foo v. US, in which the Court found that someone previously acquitted for the charged crime could not be retried for the same crime even if the trial court made errors in the original trial because a final judgment was entered in the case.¬† Double Jeopardy must ‚Äúattach‚Äù in a case in order for the defendant to be protected by it.¬† Double Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial case as soon as the jury and alternates are sworn in, and it attaches in a court trial case as soon as the first evidence is submitted or heard.You can read the whole Fong Foo decision at:http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=369&invol=141¬†Fiction: The main problem with the movie was the basis for the chase ‚Äì that once Libby found her husband she could kill him without repercussion because she had already been tried for that crime.¬† The reality is, a charged crime is a set of specific facts, like ‚ÄúMiss Scarlet, in the Dining Room, with the Knife, on October 31, 2009.‚Äù¬† If any of those facts are substantially changed, the law views the new set of facts as a separate and different crime, and thus Double Jeopardy does not apply.¬† So, for Libby to have been protected, she would have had to commit the murder in the manner it was alleged and on the same or very similar date that it was initially alleged ‚Äì not six years later after plotting in a women‚Äôs prison.¬†Hollywood Ending: In the movie, Libby ends up killing her husband out of self defense, so the ‚Äústory‚Äù ends happily enough, with she and her young son reunited, the villainous husband actually deceased, and Libby‚Äôs name being cleared.¬† However, she still did serve six years in prison for the first false conviction, and self defense can be a difficult affirmative defense to mount and win at trial.¬†Have a favorite movie that deals with legal concepts and want to know which parts are fact and which parts are fiction?¬† Post a comment!

23,4804614,Mentor‚Äôs Thoughts Week 34: I Can Change the World,http://entrecity.com/mentors-thoughts-week-34-i-can-change-the-world/,2012,"A while back we wrote about the 3 Beliefs of Entrepreneurs. One of those beliefs was that an entrepreneur can Change the World.If you read any interview of a successful entrepreneur, you will realise that they pursue their ideas because of a belief that they can solve the problem and thus help people, live their lives better. Their journey always starts ¬†with a problem they are looking to solve.Whether it is an affordable ¬†travelling issue, like what Richard Branson(Virgin) and Tony Fernandes(Air Asia), solved, , or DataWinds the team behind the Aakash Tablet who wanted to bring digital learning to the low income and the masses. All of them started their entrepreneurial journey because they passionately wanted to solve a problem. As their journey progressed, they ended up building growing or big companies around the product or service that solved the problem. An entrepreneur needs to be confident that he/she can change the world; To make it better for others. That is when they turn their passion, into an obsession which then becomes a calling. These entrepreneurs keep the problem they want to solve close to their hearts and they are able to empathise with the people facing the problems. ¬†Understanding the needs of the people well, they come out with effective solutions. As we proceed to find our passions and our calling, we perhaps could look into what moves us. What problems do you feel must be solved to help improve a situation. It can be as simple as improving the way things are done in your company, or as big a inventing something brand new that could create a whole new area of business. Before you start solving the problem, have an in-depth feel of the problem. Put yourself in the shoes of those who are facing the problem and imagine how your solution can make you feel much better. Use this to fuel your passion and find your calling. Remember, even something as small as changing how a process is done in your company or small innovations can sometimes improve lives and better still change the world.This belief (I Can Change the World) is what continues to drive entrepreneurs to greater heights, and is what amazes people who witness them. The fact that they could do things unimagined by others stems from this belief that they can change the world. Being optimistic, they believe they can achieve almost anything in this world, and beyond. They may seem egoistic at times, but it is this attitude that drives them to compete with giants, and it is this that causes them to change all the rules of the game. They redefine the rules of engagement and of how business is done, and this often catches the incumbents off guard.

In addition to my editing duties, I have written Buzzblog since January, 2006. Feel free to e-mail me at buzz@nww.com.Use commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.Contests, cake and appropriately heartfelt thanks are central to the celebration of the 14th annual System Administrator Appreciation Day this Friday.So exactly how are sysadmins and sysadmin admirers marking the occasion? What follows is a sampling of ways gleaned from Twitter and the hashtag #sysadminday:First some of you (who don't read Network World) may need to learn the basics -- such as what a system administrator is -- as this amusing ambush video from Spiceworks demonstrates:You also could show your appreciation by becoming a better user and/or sysadmin supervisor. Toward that end, ITWorld recently solicited input from actual system administrators for a story headlined, ""9 reasons sys admins hate you.""Hate is almost certainly not in the vocabulary of your sysadmin, of course.Contests are becoming a bigger part of SysAdmin Day every year as more vendors recognize the value of both system administrators and the publicity generated by giving away stuff. Among this year's contests:And here's a giveaway that doesn't even require a contest entry: In honor of SysAdmin Day, the League of Professional Systems Administrators is offering a $14 discount on its normal $50 membership fee.(Geek-themed Meme of the Week Archive)Nothing says appreciation quite like cash.Unless you'd prefer to sing The System Administrator Song:In any event, have a happy SysAdmin Day.Welcome regulars and passersby.

Use commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.By now you must have heard of Flipboard, the iPad app that re-arranges your social media content into a magazine-like experience. It's been all the rage among tech blogs for the past fews days; definitely the pundits' darling this week. That'd be fine except for one small detail: the app doesn't work.
Now to be fair, it does work for some people, but for many others there's no way to sign into your social networks (Facebook and Twitter for now, it seems) because Flipboard's servers are jammed, and have been jammed since the app launched Tuesday night. Flipboard CEO Mike McCue claims that about half the people who've tried to use the app have gotten in. Maybe that's true but I've found exactly 2 non-journalists that have managed to get their accounts entered into the app (I'm sure more will come to the surface once this blog post is published). Whatever, let's assume half is correct. McCue won't release download numbers so we don't know if half is 5,000 or 1.5 million.
[ Get news and reviews on tech toys in ITworld's personal tech newsletter]
I'm not really here to criticize Flipboard; it certainly isn't the first application or service that has suffered launch pains. But what I've found really interesting is that very few of the pieces I've seen praising the app have mentioned the problems it is having. That seems to be a crucial bit of the story to just gloss over, doesn't it? GigaOm was the first site to really address the problems earlier today (Thursday) but the app launched Tuesday night and started having problems pretty much immediately. Yet the glowing reviews keep pouring in with nary a mention of the fact that the app only works for, at best, half the people who try it. Something smells a bit fishy.
At least Flipboard themselves are owning up to the issue. In an attempt to address the problem they've released an update to the app. Now when you try to enter your Facebook or Twitter account details, a form pops up asking you for your email address so that you can be entered into a queue. Once your number comes up you'll be sent an invitation. That sounds like a beta release to me. And at the risk of piling on, this new system feels broken, too. I entered my email address and clicked the Continue button and the pop-up form disappeared, but I got no confirmation that I'd been added to any queue. If I try to enter my details again I'm offered that same form a second time, albeit with my email pre-populated. I expected to get some kind of confirmation in my inbox, but several hours later, nothing. And I wonder if the people who didn't bother to update the app are now able to get through the jammed servers. Who knows?
So again, why all the fuss about a broken app? It isn't what you do, it's who you know, that's why. Flipboard has $10.5 million in funding (which is one of the reasons I'm so hard on it...this isn't two guys building a cool app in their spare time) and according to AllThingsDigital the funders include "" ...a spate of high-profile investors, such as Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moscovitz, angel investor Ron Conway, actor Ashton Kutcher, and the investment company of former News Corp. exec Peter Chernin."" Add to that the fact that ex-iPhone engineer Evan Doll is a co-founder of the company and you know all the internet super-egos are going to be either pillorying or fawning over the first product the company releases. In this case they went with fawning.
It's a little gross, in my opinion. I'm calling out tech journalists to base their reviews of products on how those products perform for the average consumer, not how they perform during press previews, and not based on how many brownie points you want to make with the people attached to the project. As to Flipboard, I wouldn't worry about downloading it until these glitches are ironed out and the app actually works for the majority of people who try to use it. If, once it works, it's even half as good as the early reviews claim it is, it'll be something pretty special.

35,4927885,The Ingredients of Anti Aging Vitamins and Their Benefits,http://multivitamin-ingredients.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-ingredients-of-anti-aging-vitamins.html,2012,"
¬†By
         Ram K Charan    
How many of you have stared at yourself disapprovingly in the mirror and wished your youthful years returned? It is something we all whine about, women more than men. Aging doesn't always have to be this depressing, only if you know the right ways to deal with yourself. And the best time to start off is right after your first signs of aging appear. These might include age spots, wrinkles, rough skin, dead cells, more fatigue and less energy.Just like our skin starts showing signs of aging, similarly the inside mechanism of our body also starts deteriorating. It no more functions the way it did years back. Many manufacturers have worked towards the elimination of these problems in the later ages of human beings and they have successfully come up with extremely effective anti aging vitamins. You will be surprised how many different varieties are there in the supplements shop to choose. These anti aging vitamins will definitely not give you a longer life or an exceptionally attractive face, but it will just help you age in a very graceful and acceptable manner. Above all, this will undoubtedly boost your confidence and enhance your self-esteem.In today's world where the consumption of the fast foods has increased on a tremendous scale, people tend to take less of the vitamins and all the nutrition necessary for the healthy function of the body. In their absence, the body starts displaying signs which you will later regret. Making these anti aging vitamins a part of your daily diet will give your body the right amount of nutrition it requires for functioning efficiently. It is certainly not difficult to find and purchase these anti aging vitamins. They are available at every drugstore and almost every over the counter store. But you have to make sure that you purchase the right one for yourself as it will greatly determine its effects on you. Multivitamins are the most recommended one for you as they give you all the benefits you need and are also used as beauty agents. You should see the drug facts and make sure there are all the vitamin ingredients. There are a few mentioned below which will help you determine the best choice.Vitamin E:This repairs dry, cracked skin and is often used in sunscreens. This also prevents the frequent clotting of blood. This is present in green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils.Vitamin C:This acts like an antioxidant and helps prevent all the damage to skin which is the result of the presence of the free radicals (molecules responsible for skin damage). This also has cancer preventing qualities. Citrus is rich in vitamin C.Vitamin K:With the intake of vitamin K, you can avoid the leaking of capillaries around the eyes which may also cause wrinkles and dark circles around your eyes.Niacin:This is a vitamin B-3 and will cure dry, scaly and itchy skin.Vitamin A:Essential for your bone health, vitamin A will also fight skin problems caused by radicals and oxidants. Though multivitamins come with a handful of benefits and are much easier to take than the fruits and vegetables which can replace them. But you have to be careful not to depend solely on the consumption of these vitamins. Once you start getting used to them, you will try avoiding things such as grains, nuts, vegetables and fruits and eliminating from your diet would not seem as a problem to you. So make sure you use everything as far as it is being of appropriate use.

	Uber has just sent out an update via email regarding the pricing options in New York after Hurricane Sandy. Surge Pricing is back.Yesterday, the company implemented Surge Pricing ‚Äî a higher rate during times of high demand ‚Äî and then abruptly turned it off after a poor reaction by the internet. Instead, the company charged regular pricing, yet paid the drivers at Surge Price rates, likely slashing margins into losses.In the update sent out via email, the company explains that Surge Pricing will be back in effect this afternoon for customers in Manhattan. A copy of the email is below, but in short: Paying drivers at a 2x rate while charging customers normal pricing did increase the number of drivers on the road (by 3x), but at the cost of $100,000 in additional payments to drivers in one day, ‚Äúsomething we can‚Äôt continue indefinitely without breaking the bank,‚Äù the letter says.Some feel that Surge pricing is the equivalent of price gouging. But it‚Äôs not. Anyone who lives in a metropolitan area dependent on public transportation knows that cabs are almost impossible to find on inordinately busy nights. Surge Pricing entices more drivers than usual to come out and work on a night like New Year‚Äôs Eve or Halloween, and keeps Ubers on the road.On New Year‚Äôs Eve, the Surge Price rate was 6.25x. Yesterday after Sandy, prices in New York were only at 2x, and only for an hour before numerous blogs, even ours, and Twitter came down on the transportation startup.With today‚Äôs implemented Surge Pricing, Uber isn‚Äôt taking any part of the fee. Some have accused Uber of greedily raking in the 20 percent fees it takes per ride, so this should calm those people down a bit, considering yesterday‚Äôs and today‚Äôs losses for the company.The rate isn‚Äôt a flat surge rate, but the app will notify users when they hail a car.Here‚Äôs the full letter, for your reference:First and foremost, we hope that you and your family and friends are safe. The Uber NYC office is currently closed and some of our team members are without water and power.With limited public transportation, demand for Uber rides is astronomically high. That means we‚Äôre working to get as many drivers out as possible to help New Yorkers get around the city. So, in order to maximize the number of drivers on the system yesterday, we started paying drivers 2x the fare on all trips ‚Äì and in the meantime charging riders the standard 1x fare avoiding surge pricing for most of the day after Sandy. Doubling drivers‚Äô fares tripled the number of cars on the road and kept them out there far longer. However, footing the bill for higher driver costs came at a significant expense to Uber with over $100,000 in additional payments to drivers in a single day ‚Äì something we can‚Äôt continue indefinitely without breaking the bank.So while we were mostly able to avoid higher prices the day after Sandy, the reality is that under this week‚Äôs extreme conditions, raising the price is the only sustainable way to maximize the number of rides and minimize the number of people stranded ‚Äì by providing a meaningful incentive for drivers to come out in undesirable conditions.Later this morning we will be reverting back to standard Surge Pricing for riders. It is a hard decision, but one we feel strongly about. Without raising the price, there will be less than ¬Ω the number of drivers on the system with several times more demand on far fewer drivers. Without Surge Pricing, Uber would become essentially unusable this week. For those needing a ride this week, it‚Äôs going to be expensive; there will be a clear pricing notification in the app at the time of request. During this emergency price increase, Uber will waive all of its own fees with 100% of the fare going directly to the drivers helping New Yorkers move around the city.You can read more about Surge Pricing on our blog: http://blog.uber.com/2012/03/14/clear-and-straight-forward-surge-pricing/Our thoughts and prayers are with all New Yorkers in this time of crisis. We‚Äôre going to do everything we can to continue to provide the most reliable, efficient transportation option for NYC. Be safe, and stay Uber.The Uber NYC Team

Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment options start with¬†understanding the biomechanical factors and usually responds quickly to appropriate conservative care. When a young patient is seen with knee pain just below the kneecap, a close evaluation of the knee for swelling and tenderness should be considered suspicious. X-rays are needed to rule out other pathological diseases. If Osgood-Schlatter goes untreated the patient may have greater problems later on in life as an adult. Osgood-Schlatter is more common in boys, but with more girls participating in sports there has been a higher frequency noted. When looking at Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment options, research has shown the occurance¬†between young boys is usually between the ages of 10 ‚Äì 15 years and girls between the ages of 8-13.Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment¬†involves a¬†chronic problem that recurs over a period of months to several years and resolving by the age of 18. Osgood-Schlatter is made worse by running, jumping and climbing or descending stairs. Usually there is not single event that can be identified as the genesis of Osgood-Schlatter disease. Usually the area around the insertion of the patellar tendon is tender and swollen. Resisted knee extension at 90 degrees usually increases the pain. Osgood-Schlatter¬†disease treatment¬†begins when¬†excessive biomechanical forces¬†are placed on the patella tendon at its insertion into the growing tuberosity. This action disrupts the normal ligamentous attachments to the knee causing inflammation, swelling and pain with use. During the growth spurt the muscle-tendon imbalance commonly develops when the bones lengthen more rapidly than the muscle and connective tissues. This imbalance often results in tight and inflexible muscle groups causing an increase traction force on the site with repetitive activities involved with sports. Considerations to help Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment are: Restricted activity: jumping, sprinting, kicking, deep squats, and other stresses on the tibial tendon should be eliminated while easy jogging should be encouraged. Immobilization is not recommended. Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment starts with frequent ice massage or cold packs can help reduce inflammation. Supplements with enzymes to reduce inflammation and promote healing.¬†Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment should include gentle, repeated progressive stretches to improve the length and flexibility of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment may consider ¬†strap or brace specific for Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment¬†should provide support for the patellar tendon during athletic activities. Stabilizing orthotics to help correct excessive pronation, fixed supination , calcaneal eversion, tibial rotation or heel strike cushion should be considered in the management of Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment. Early treatment is best. If the Osgood-Schlatter disease treatment¬†is not¬†addressed correctly or if the parents feel that success in sports is more important than the growing body, adult problems may arise.

50,5972327,Finding Angel Money is Easier if You Know the Rules,http://www.alleywatch.com/2013/07/finding-angel-money-is-easier-if-you-know-the-rules/,2013,"By Martin Zwilling ¬∑ July 1, 2013  ¬†¬∑ 3  Angel/Seed, Funding, Popular, ResourcesFundraising is brutal. Actually, according to¬†Paul Graham, ‚ÄúRaising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup. The hardest part is making something people want.‚Äù More startups may fail for that reason, but a close second is the difficulty of raising money.A while back, I outlined ‚ÄúThe 10 Best Sources of Cash to Start Your Business‚Äù for startups, listing angel investors as alternative No. 6. I still get a lot of questions on these mysterious and often invisible investors, so here is another attempt to bring them out of the ether.By definition, an angel investor is not an ‚Äúinstitutional investor.‚Äù Venture Capitalists (VCs) are paid to invest other people‚Äôs money and are measured on the rate of return they get. Angels are typically high net worth individuals who are investing their own money for a wide range of motives.So ‚Äúgood‚Äù angels are ones with motives that are consistent with what you bring to the table. This means they usually invest in people who have the right ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù and areas of business they already know. They tend to work locally, so they can ‚Äútouch and feel‚Äù their investments.Angel investors also tend to limit the size of individual investments to $250,000 or less. If you need more, you need VCs or a flock of angels. So how do you find those good angels?Remember that angels have a culture all their own, and it pays to understand how to deal positively with them after you find one. There are some books out there to help, such as the one I just published with Joe Bockerstette, titled ‚ÄúAttracting an Angel ‚Äì How to Get Money from Business Angels and Why Most Entrepreneurs Don‚Äôt,‚Äù and an old standby called ‚ÄúThe Art of The Start‚Äù by Guy Kawasaki.Even if you follow this recipe, you are likely to find that fundraising is a brutal challenge. But if it results in a good angel or two watching over your startup, you will definitely be one step closer to heaven.Reprinted by permission.Martin is the CEO & Founder of Startup Professionals, Inc., a consultancy focused on assisting entrepreneurs with mentoring, business strategy and planning, and networking.Martin for years has provided entrepreneurs with first-hand advice, mentoring and business plan assistance as a startup consultant.

52,1199199,Filmspiration ‚Äì The Only Successful Videogame Movie Ever,http://www.inspiredm.com/2010/03/17/run-lola-run/,2010,"creativity & inspiration dailyEven though I‚Äôm a filmmaker by profession, it‚Äôs my firm belief that videogames will be the dominant artform of the 21st century.  The adaptation of videogame hits into big spectacle movie blockbusters seems like a logical, straightforward and businesslike endeavor with little room for failure.  So how come ALL of the videogame movie adaptations so far have been so aggressively pathetic?  Let‚Äôs not get started on Uwe Boll, bless his heart ‚Äì he‚Äôs too easy a target ‚Äì it‚Äôs just so disappointing when films we think (hope) are going to be at least decent (Silent Hill, I‚Äôm talking to you), turn out to be such barely competent, affect-free drearfests.Maybe it‚Äôs because mainstream videogames are produced by teams of hundreds of incredibly smart, creative, hardworking, dedicated enthusiasts, whereas videogame film scripts are produced by ones of talentless sellout writers, arrogant cokehead directors and greedy, clueless studio suits.  Who can tell?  (N.B. no disrespect to the indie game devs working alone who are doing incredible work ‚Äì and absolutely total respect to the cast and crews of these films, who are all experts doing their best ‚Äì but they can only work with what they‚Äôve got).In my humble opinion, there has only been one successful video game movie so far ‚Äì it‚Äôs not even based on a videogame, but it encapsulates everything that those countless game films ought to have delivered and much, much more ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the amazing Run Lola Run written and directed by the wonderful Tom Tykwer and featuring star-making performances by Franka Potente as the eponymous heroine, and Moritz Bleibtreu as her fuckup boyfriend.The fundamental structural difference between videogames and film is that games offer the promise of an active, immersive sandbox experience of infinite possible variation, whereas movies are, of necessity (thus far) passive ‚Äúon rails‚Äù spectacles.  That‚Äôs fair enough ‚Äì people love movies because they allow them to sit back, relax, and let someone tell them a story.  Tykwer‚Äôs genius has been to create an on-rails experience that somehow manages to capture the energy, liberation and spontaneity of a sandbox environment through a stream of ceaseless cinematic invention, structural design flair and, above all, a sincere belief in the values of humanism, empathy and kindness.I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything for those of you who have not yet seen this masterpiece, but in brief, the story goes like this:  Lola receives a phonecall from her boyfriend Manni who has accidentally left a bag containing $100,000 on a train which has been picked up by a homeless guy.  His life depends on delivering the money to the mob by noon, so Lola has 20 minutes to somehow find the money and get it to him.The theme of the movie is the concept of free-will, the causal consequences of our most trivial decisions, and the radical differences of outcome that can result from the tiniest variations of deterministic factors.  Tykwer illustrates this philosophical conundrum by replaying Lola‚Äôs 20 minute challenge three times, each time with small modifications of choice which lead to completely different outcomes.From a design point of view the pleasure lies in experiencing the non-stop flow of crazed visual invention.  Tykwer throws everything and the kitchen sink into the pot and swirls it round and round with a manic glee ‚Äì animation, black and white, slo-mo, undercrank, flash-forward polaroid photomontages, you name it, it‚Äôs all grist to the mill ‚Äì but the end result is a completely coherent and committed artistic statement that grips from first frame to last.I‚Äôll be keeping an open mind about some of the upcoming Hollywood videogame adaptations ‚Äì Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, and Warcraft might just be that first adaptation masterpiece we‚Äôve been eagerly awaiting for so long.  But until then for me there‚Äôs only one videogame movie worthy of your valuable time, and that‚Äôs RUN LOLA RUN!And where I can download yours videogame movie RUN LOLA RUN?Crank could be considered somewhat of a Videogame inspired movie too‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt great but it was pretty entertainingclive owen was in the film?Erhm‚Ä¶ Run Lola Run really has nothing to do with video games imo. It‚Äôs, as you‚Äôve said, an illustration of how different choices can have drastically different outcomes (it is fantastic though, I agree).As for your original discussion of why video game movies usually are bad, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because games and movies have completely different structures. Take a game like Half-Life 2 ‚Äì fantastic game with a great plot, right? Would it make a good movie? no, for two reasons:
1. It‚Äôs maybe 20 hours long. Trying to compress that into 1.5-2 hours of video is impossible without loosing a lot of content
2. Large parts of the game have no narrative since it‚Äôs composed of game play elements as opposed to story progression, and when there is story, it‚Äôs mostly one sided dialogue. Thus, large parts of the movie will be significantly lacking in narrative.It looks great! I want to download this game tooRun Lola Run is really not a videogame movie, at all.The title of this article should of been, Reviewed : A film from 1998.Clive own is an excellent actor, watched all his films.It‚Äôs hard not to agree, but hopefully future movies based on video games will be stronger than in the past.Clive Owen isn‚Äôt in the film as far as I remember. If anything the movie here should have been Shoot‚ÄôEm Up which did star Clive Owen and was blatantly just a fun, video-game-esque movie. Park your brain and enjoy.@Dyl, Fun is definitely one word, if you can count the gun shots in the movie that would be a great challenge, just the opening scene has about a zillion! lol"

54,4960659,Manifiesto por la Guerrilla del Acceso Abierto,http://endefensadelsl.org/guerrilla_del_acceso_abierto.html,2012,"Posted on 19/11/2012. Last modified 02/14/2016Publicado en Internet Archive https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifestoIn faun and mpj.Information is power. But as with all power, there are those who want to keep for themselves. Scientific and cultural heritage of the whole world, for centuries published in books and journals, digitized and is being increasingly captured by a handful of private corporations. You want to read the papers presenting the most famous results of science? You&#39;ll have to send a lot of money to publishers like Reed Elsevier.There are those who struggle to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not give up their right to copy, but to ensure that their work is published on the Internet under terms that allow access to anyone. But even in the best scenarios, their work will only be applied to things that are published in the future. Everything that exists until now has been lost.That&#39;s a high price to pay for. To force scholars to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? ¬øScan entire libraries to only allow people to read Google? ¬øProvide scientific articles to those in elite universities First World, but not the children of the Global South? It is outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;I agree,&quot; many say, &quot;but what can we do? The companies hold copyrighting, make huge amounts of money by charging for access and is perfectly legal &#39;There&#39;s nothing we can do to stop them, &quot;But there is something we can do, something that is already being done. We can fight back.To you, with access to these resources-students, librarians, scientists-have been granted a privilege. You can feed on this feast of knowledge while the rest of the world is outside. But it is not necessary-in fact, morally, it is not possibly stay this privilege for you. They have a duty to share it with the world. And they have done: exchanging passwords with colleagues, making download requests for friends.Meanwhile, those of you who have been left out are not idly. They&#39;ve been sneaking through holes and climbing fences, releasing the enclosed information by publishing and sharing it with friends.But all these actions happen in the dark, hidden underground. They are called theft or piracy, as if sharing the wealth of knowledge was the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and killing the crew. But sharing is not immoral-it is a moral imperative. Only those who are blinded by greed would refuse to give a copy to a friend.Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require-their shareholders would rise by much less. And politicians who have purchased support them, passing laws that give them exclusive power to decide who can make copies.There is no justice in obeying unjust laws. It&#39;s time to come to light and in the great tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.We need to take information wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take things that are free of copy right and add them to this file. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight a guerrilla war for Open Access.If we are enough, around the world, not only send a strong message in opposition to the privatization of-the knowledge we will make a thing of the past.

Europe this summer launched the ‚ÄúHelix Nebula‚Äù as a way to offer super cloud power to public sector research projects in fields like physics and disaster risk management. The so-called ‚Äúscience cloud, ‚Äù which is up and running thanks to creative cooperation between the public and private sector, is already providing valuable lessons for both scientists and governments.Speaking at GigaOM‚Äôs Structure Europe conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Robert Jenkins of CloudSigma explained that¬†‚Äúwhen you give people the data, you don‚Äôt know the end result but it comes up with a lot of positive outcomes.‚ÄùJenkins gave the example of the World Health Organization tapping into data from the European Space Agency in order to improve mosquito eradication efforts in Nigeria. These type of collaborations are possible in part thanks to CloudSigma and other private companies that are helping to supply the computing power required to collect and parse data across Europe.Ensuring that publicly funded-research produces public data has also resulted in an eco-system of small and media enterprises, according to Bob Jones of CERN who joined Jenkins at the event. Jones said this eco-system and the power of the cloud is producing the type of inter-disciplinary algorithms that are necessary to solve current science and policy problems.Moderator Kris Tuttle, who is CEO of SoundView Technology Group, asked how to determine a common resource unit or module when working in such a vast ‚Äúfederated cloud.‚Äù Jenkins said the answer is to focus on deliverables rather than resource units, offering the example of a gene sequencing project in which the customer simply cares about how long it will take to get the job done rather than the specifics of the implementation process.The speakers also noted that working in the European science cloud also provides practice and credibility for companies that want to serve private sector industries like finance, media and biotech.Finally, the discussion produced some mind-boggling science stats like the fact that the Helix Nebula is now using 200,000 CPUs to continuously churn data. Jones also noted that maintenance windows are 18 months due to the fact that much of the work is occurring near a temperature of 270 kelvin ‚Äî meaning that machines have to be slowly warmed up from a state of near absolute zero.Check out¬†the rest of our Structure Europe 2012 coverage here.¬†A video recording of the session follows below.TagsBob Jones CERN CloudSigma Kris Tuttle media enterprises science cloud SoundView TechnologyComments are closed.2017 Knowingly, Inc.

58,8675993,Flickr is about to sell off your Creative Commons photos,http://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/22757/1/flickr-is-about-to-sell-off-your-creative-commons-photos,2014,"Are you one of the millions of people signed up to¬†Flickr? It's time to switch your license settings. The Yahoo-owned photo-sharing site has just announced that it will start selling prints of some 50 million Creative Commons-licensed images, but the photographers involved won't see any of the profits. Nope. Not a single penny.¬†Over 300 million Flickr images come under the Creative Commons license, which allows people¬†to reuse and repurpose these images for free under certain conditions. Photographers can say, for example, if¬†they're only happy with non-commercial usage or specify what kind of credit they want to receive.But the vast majority of licensed images are up for grabs commercially ‚Äì which means that Flickr is perfectly within its rights to start flogging them off. The site plans to handpick a few select photographers who will get 51% of the sales, but¬†the¬†vast majority of people¬†will see their images printed onto canvas and sold for up to $49 a pop. The only credit they'll get is a small sticker at the bottom of the print bearing their name.Some amateur photographers say¬†that they'd be grateful for the added exposure, but others are taken aback by the move.¬†‚ÄúWhen I accepted the Creative Commons license, I understood that my images could be used for things like showing up in articles or other works where they could be showed to public,‚Äù Lisbon-based photographer Nelson Louren√ßo told the Wall Street Journal.¬†‚Äú(But Flickr) selling my work and getting the full money out of it came as a surprise.‚ÄùEven the guy who co-founded the company doesn't think this is a good idea. Tech entrepreneur Stewart Butterfield left the company in 2008, but says that Yahoo-ordained plan is¬†‚Äúa little shortsighted‚Äù. He added:¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine the revenue from selling the prints will cover the cost of lost goodwill‚Äù.In short: just because you¬†can¬†do something, doesn't mean you should. Flickr might be legally allowed to profit off its users' creativity, but it might just blow up in their faces. So if you've got images on Flickr, now's the time to check your licenses.¬†¬†Head here for all our photography coverage.Follow Sing Cheng on Twitter here @misszingFollow the @dazednews team on InstagramHave some news?

60,7029515,Having Notification Headache?,http://ux.stackexchange.com/q/49883/4679,2014,"We all use notifications in some form to keep us informed of what is happening around us. If we got a new e-mail, a new  text message, a missed phone call, a mention in a tweet, a Facebook like or comment, Instagram happening... The list is almost without end, especially when it comes to Social Media applications. Some users may be happy about notifications. I know I am when I get a like, a comment or a text message. It means that other people care what I do and if I return the favor that he/she means something for me. Especially now when I'm yet again an uncle for my kid brother. We use Facebook group messages and I like to communicate with my three younger brothers and Mom (Dad don't do Facebook). But from the other perspective, there are some who feel that they want to ""get rid of notifications"" which get more than 16'000 hits on a Google search with quotation marks. Searching for ""push notifications"" renders well over a million hits. There is also a Mashable article HOW TO: Get Rid of Annoying Facebook Notifications which is shared 2'000 times. It's fair to assume that notifications affect some users in a negative way. But how? I know I and my friends sometimes hits an app on the phone, just to get rid of the notification - not read what is notified on. Is there more, and possibly other unwanted behavior surronding users and their notification behavior?How does Notifications affect User Behavior?The simple answer to your question is that first and foremost, they are distractions. This isn't about their utility or importance, but just how they affect the user, which is that by definition, notifications - whether pushed to your phone or flashing on your toolbar - are intended to interrupt them.The goal of these interruptions be their nature is to inform you  about something of perceived importance, at the very least, and/or get you to take action on something that needs it. Without this criteria a notification is just a nuisance. But if we think through that, what happens?If the notification is purely informative, you still are reminded of it, and it ever so slightly takes up your cognitive load as your mind registers the notification, processes it and dismisses it. This mental load adds up with each new ding or flash and detracts from your productivity and your thinking, which is why any guru or blogger discussing the subject of productivity at work, or meditation, or just getting in ""the zone"", will tell you to remove all distractions. Even leaving the notification alone, i.e. watching that number pile up with unread emails, is a constant source of agitation because users are so used to getting rid of that, and it literally becomes an addiction.Needing to take action on a notification is even more of a cognitive load, even in its most basic form of confirming an alert, say. More involved alerts that require you to switch between tasks or apps force you to spend time multitasking, which has been thoroughly proven to waste more time than it saves. Read ""The Myth of Multitasking""(.pdf) as an example.That is the drawback of notifications, and why turning them off has become so common. Of course, what is very important to note here is context. Since you mentioned the iPhone a few times I'll use their push notifications as examples but the principles can be applied anywhere:Importance: a lot of apps use notifications as nothing more than marketing vehicles to remind users to use those apps. Trivial in their own right but a constant distraction if not turned off.Frequency: I would surmise Facebook gets a lot of loathing because that is a type of app that has the potential to send you a flood of alerts, by the minute: for chats, for new posts and tagged photos, etc etc. It doesn't matter how important the content is - you wouldn't want to be reminded of it every two minutes.Priority: If you have one app on your phone that sends you an important notification, you might decide to keep it because it is indeed important enough to you that it outweighs the distraction. If you end up getting 5 more apps, each with their own alerts, you start reevaluating that mindset, and start prioritizing what is the most important among all apps. That original app's alerts in this new context, might not be as relevant as it was.So in essence, every user will react to the same notification differently, and to reiterate, I don't want to imply that all notifications are trivial or unnecessary, but the takeaway is that they are intended distractions. Whether that interruption is worth the value of whatever info/task that alert is providing, is up to the user to first realize then decide.Notification icons are good practice especially on mobile devices as a more efficient way of staying up to date with email & social media. It tells us that someone cared about our post, or we have a new message from a real person. Because of this, popular apps such as FaceBook and Gmail are acceptable use for alert icons.However, this is not to say some users will find it disturbing. It becomes annoying when apps give notifications on things that don't involve human interaction. We find it a prompt, other than a message worth attending to.Even if it does involve human interaction, an alert that involves a favor from others with no clear indication of rewards is annoying. Consider experiencing these sample alerts hundreds of times a day:or, receiving a notification only when you expect it:In a world of mobile, too many apps are implementing notifications to users in wrong ways. When you have a consistency of worthy notifications, that's when users will learn to pay attention to your app. I would not hesitate to make good use of mobile notification icons, as long as it is deserving of the user's attention.Sign up using GoogleSign up using FacebookSign up using Email and Password

61,7404106,Inside the Crazy Lab Where the Army Spikes Its Rations With Caffeine,http://www.wired.com/opinion/2014/03/military-obsession-with-caffeine/,2014,"üîä It's time we talk about the Vault 7 revelations and they mean for customers. bit.ly/2ma7oIbIt‚Äôs easy to think of caffeine and our national obsession with stimulants as a recent phenomenon, but it‚Äôs not. Consider this statement: ‚ÄúA chemical substance which stimulates brain, nerves, and muscles, is a daily necessity and is used by every single nation. When there is fatigue and the food is diminished such a stimulant is indispensable, and must be an ingredient of every reserve and emergency ration.‚Äù That‚Äôs from the 1896 Report of the Secretary of War, and more than a century later, the U.S. military is still trying to figure out how best to caffeinate soldiers. A handy result of this is that military scientists have conducted some of the most useful research on caffeine.Some of that research is conducted at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, half an hour west of Boston. It would look like a large suburban office park but for the soldiers standing guard at a gatehouse complete with a blast barrier. Since 1962, the height of the Cold War, researchers at Natick have been developing products to improve conditions for soldiers in the field.One of the buildings at Natick has a brightly lit room called the Warfighter Cafe. That‚Äôs where Betty Davis, who leads the Performance Optimization Research Team, showed me a small table covered with snack foods‚Äîapplesauce, beef jerky, energy bars, and nutritious ‚Äútube foods,‚Äù which taste like pudding but come in a package that looks like a large tube of Crest. The products have two things in common. They are formulated for soldiers (‚Äúwarfighters‚Äù in the current Department of Defense lexicon). And they all contain added caffeine.Davis showed me a plastic-wrapped ration, about the size of a small hardcover book. It‚Äôs called a First Strike ration, a concentrated package of nutrition designed for soldiers moving quickly with minimal gear. The First Strike rations include plenty of caffeine.For starters, there is Stay Alert gum, with five pieces per pack, each piece containing 100 milligrams. This was originally developed by a subsidiary of Wrigley, working with researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. And there is Zapplesauce, caffeinated applesauce. It comes in a plastic pouch and packs 110 milligrams of caffeine. There is a mocha-flavored First Strike Nutritious Energy Bar, also packing 110 milligrams of caffeine. Some of the rations also include instant coffee (which soldiers sometimes put between their cheek and gum, like a dip of Skoal, a sort of do-it-yourself version of the Grinds Coffee Pouches) or caffeinated mints. [An average 8 oz. cup of coffee has 95 milligrams of caffeine, according to the USDA.]In a little bowl on the table, Davis had a pile of caffeinated meat sticks that looked like Slim Jims, sliced into two-inch lengths. As I chewed on one‚Äîwhich was delicious‚ÄîHarris Lieberman, a psychologist with the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, walked in and asked, ‚ÄúAre they feeding you already?‚ÄùLieberman, who has studied the drug for three decades, has an encyclopedic knowledge of caffeine. In fact, he has written encyclopedia entries on caffeine. And he understands its advantages for soldiers. He tried a piece of the beef jerky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it really does completely mask the caffeine.‚ÄùCaffeine‚Äôs naturally bitter flavor presented a challenge when developing Stay Alert gum. ‚ÄúThe formulation is not optimized the way a gum is normally optimized to get the sustained flavor and the pleasurable flavor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe whole point is that you don‚Äôt have this very bitter flavor when you start chewing.‚ÄùWhile the flavoring was a challenge, the gum has a big advantage over more traditional caffeine delivery mechanisms: The caffeine tends to be absorbed sublingually in the mucous membranes. Scientists at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research found that the caffeinated kick of gum takes full effect within five to ten minutes, as opposed to thirty to forty-five minutes for caffeine ingested in a pill or a beverage like coffee or cola.Lieberman said products that offer such rapid delivery of caffeine have applications beyond the military. ‚ÄúJust to give you an example from the civilian sector, if you‚Äôre driving and you become sleepy suddenly, you want to be able to quickly fix that problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to wait for the caffeine to start working. You want to get the effect as immediately as you possibly can, before you have an accident. And certainly there are a lot of potential military applications, where you need to solve the problem immediately. Minutes can make a difference in these situations.‚ÄùScott Killgore is an expert on sleep and caffeine use in the military. When I met the neuropsychologist, he was sitting at a sort of cockpit before three large computer monitors in his office with a view over the leafy lawn of McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.Killgore spent five years on active duty, trying to understand how to help soldiers serving under the stresses of combat, especially through the use of caffeine. He said soldiers face contradictory threats. On one hand, there is the possibility of a surprise attack of deadly force. On the other, the draining tugs of boredom and exhaustion.‚ÄúIn the military, quite often you find yourself in situations where you are changing time zones or you need to stay up all night to do a watch, and there may be times when you are not able to get the amount of sleep that you need,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd during those times, a person may need to take some kind of a caffeinated supplement, like a caffeinated gum, that might help you to stay alert and awake and vigilant. A lot of times military watch may be very boring, but one critical incident may be a life-or-death incident, and you need to stay awake and alert during that time.‚ÄùIn one study, Killgore and his colleagues at Walter Reed looked at twenty-five active-duty military subjects. The subjects were not allowed to sleep for three nights, while they received either caffeinated gum or a placebo, administered in double-blind conditions. The caffeine group got two hundred milligrams of caffeine every two hours, in four doses.To study the drug‚Äôs effect on risk-taking behavior, Killgore used a Balloon Analog Risk Test (BART). In essence, the subjects used laptops that displayed a balloon. If they pumped up the balloon until it was pretty big but did not pop, they would get a cash reward. If the balloon popped, no cash.Killgore wrote, ‚ÄúOverall, after three nights without sleep, those receiving caffeine were popping fewer balloons and taking home more money than those receiving placebo, suggesting that caffeine was protective against behaviorally measured impairments in risk-related judgment and impulsiveness during prolonged sleep deprivation.‚ÄùIn might be hard to imagine the direct civilian application for these findings unless you are a high-stakes gambler on a three-day poker jag. But the tension between boredom and danger that soldiers experience is analogous to many everyday civilian situations. In a way, it is like firefighters zoning out before the TV at a station house, then suddenly having to respond to a four-alarm fire. Or an ER doctor rising from a snooze to treat a newly admitted accident victim. Less dramatic, but just as much a life-or-death situation, is a long-haul trucker pulling into Los Angeles at two a.m. on the ragged edge of a three-day run. So maybe chew some caffeinated gum, or at least hit the Starbucks, before you attack the crossword.Adapted from üîä It's time we talk about the Vault 7 revelations and they mean for customers. bit.ly/2ma7oIbüîä It's time we talk about the Vault 7 revelations and they mean for customers. bit.ly/2ma7oIbWe get it: Ads aren‚Äôt what you‚Äôre here for.

62,7756070,P-Values or How I learned to Love Small Data,http://conversionxl.com/pulling-back-curtain-p-values-learned-love-small-data,2014," MENU CXLFor all of the talk about how awesome (and big, don‚Äôt forget big) Big data is, one of the favorite tools in the conversion optimization toolkit, A/B Testing, is decidedly small data.Optimization, winners and losers, Lean this that or the other thing, at the end of the day, A/B Testing is really just an application of sampling.You take couple of alternative options (eg. ‚Äò50% off‚Äô v ‚ÄòBuy One Get One Free‚Äô ) and try them out with a portion of your users. You see how well each one did and then make a decision about which one you think will give you the most return.Sounds simple, and in a way it is, yet there seem to be lots of questions around significance testing, and in particular what the heck is the p-value is, and how to interpret it to help best make sound business decisions.These are actually deep questions & in order to begin to get a handle on them, you need to have a basic grasp of sampling.I had a math professor in college who would go absolutely ballistic whenever anyone in class made a basic conceptual mistake. He must have grown up on a farm, since his stock phrases had an agrarian flavor to them.His favorite was ‚Äòhow can you make cheese if you don‚Äôt know where milk comes from?!‚ÄôBy which he meant, presumably, one can‚Äôt effectively put ideas into practice unless the conceptual foundations are understood. A/B Testing is the cheese and sampling is the milk ‚Äìlet‚Äôs go find out where we get the milk.Before we get going, we should quickly go over the basic building blocks of our A/B Tests. I am sure you know this stuff already, but can‚Äôt hurt to make sure everyone is on the same pageThe Mean ‚Äì the average. I don‚Äôt need to say more except to maybe remind you that for conversion rates it is simply the number of events multiplied by the probability of success (n*p).The Variance ‚Äì This can be thought of as the average variability of our data. The main take away is that the higher the variability, the less precise the mean will be as a predictor of any individual data point.The Probability Distribution ‚Äì this is a function (if you don‚Äôt like ‚Äòfunction‚Äô, just think of it as a rule) that assigns a probability to a result or outcome. For example, the roll of a single die follows a uniform distribution since each outcome is assigned an equal probability of occurring (all the numbers has a 1 in 6 chance of coming up).In our discussion of sampling we will make heavy use of the normal distribution, which has the familiar bell shape. Remember, that the probability of the entire distribution sums to 1 (or 100%).The test statistic is the value that we use in our statistical tests to compare the results of our two (or more) options ‚Äì our ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚ÄòB‚Äô.It might be easier to just think of the test statistic as one more KPI. If our test KPI is close to zero, then we don‚Äôt have much evidence to show that the two options are really that different.However, the further from zero our KPI is, the more evidence we have that the two options are not really performing the same.Our new KPI combines both the different in the averages of our test options, and incorporates the variability in our test results. The test statistics looks something like this:Mean of ‚ÄòB‚Äô-Mean of ‚ÄòA‚ÄôVariance of ‚ÄòB‚Äô+Variance of ‚ÄòA‚Äô*1/nSo, for example, say I have two cups of coffee, and I want to know which one is hotter and by how much. First, I would measure the temperature of each coffee. Next, I would see which one has the highest temp. Finally, I would subtract the lower temp coffee from the higher to get the difference in temperature. Obvious and super simple.Now, let‚Äôs say you want to ask, ‚Äúwhich place in my town has the hotter coffee, McDonald‚Äôs or Starbucks?‚Äù Well, each place makes lots of cups of coffee, so I am going to have to compare a collection of cups of coffee. Any time we have to measure and compare collections of things, we need to use our test statistics.The more variability in the temperature of coffee at each restaurant, the more we weigh down the observed difference to account for our uncertainty.So, even if we have a pretty sizable difference on top, if we have lots of variability on the bottom, our test statistic will still be close to zero. As a result of this, the more variability in our data, the greater an observed difference we will need to get a high score on our test KPI.Remember, high test KPI=more evidence that any difference isn‚Äôt just by chance.Okay now that we have that out of the way, we can spend a bit of time on sampling so we can shed some light on the mysterious P-Value.For sake of illustration, let say we are trying to promote a conference that specializes in Web analytics and Conversion optimization. Since our conference will be a success only if we have at least certain minimum of attendees, we want to incent users to buy their tickets early. In the past, we have used ‚ÄòAnalytics200‚Äô as our early bird promotional discount code to reduce the conference price by $200. However, given that A/B Testing is such a hot topic right now, maybe if we use ‚ÄòA/BTesting200‚Äô as our promo code, we might get even more folks to sign up early. So we plan on running an A/B test between our control, ‚ÄòAnalytics200‚Äô and our alternative ‚ÄòA/BTesting200‚Äô.We often talk about A/B Testing as one activity or task. However, there are really two main parts of the actual mechanics of testing.The nuances between them rest on different fundamental assumptions of probability and statistics. In a nutshell, Fisher thought of of the p-value as a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis (the control in A/B Testing parlance). Pearson & Neyman, introduced the ideas of Type 1 and Type 2 errors.Jeffreys test attempts to calculate is based on a bayesian interpretation of probability, which can very loosely be thought of as a measure of certainty or belief. This is a quite different than the Frequentist notion of probability, which is defined, again loosely, as the long term frequency of some process. Hence the name Frequentists. (. We are going mostly follow Fisher, since p-values are fundamental to Fisher‚Äôs approach to testingSally and Bob are waiting for Jim to pick them up one night after work. While Bob catches a ride with Jim almost every night, this is Sally‚Äôs first time. Bob tells Sally that on average he has to wait about 5 minutes for Jim. After about 15 minutes of waiting, Sally is starting to think that maybe Jim isn‚Äôt coming to get them. So she asks Bob, ‚ÄòHey, you said Jim is here in 5 minutes on average, is a 15 minute wait normal?‚Äô Bob, replies, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry, with the traffic, it is not uncommon to have wait this long or even a bit longer. I‚Äôd say based on experience, a wait like this, or worse, probably happens about 15% of the time.‚Äô Sally relaxes a bit, and they chat about the day while they wait for Jim.Notice that Sally only asked about the frequency of long wait times. Once she heard that her observed wait time wasn‚Äôt too uncommon, she felt more comfortable that Jim was going to show up. What is interesting is what she really wants to know is the probability that Jim is going to stand them up. But this is NOT what she learns. Rather, she just knows, given all the times that Jim has picked up Bob, what is the probability is of him being 15 minutes, or more, late. This indirect logic is the essence of classical statistical testing.For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say that the ‚ÄòAnalytics200‚Äô promotion has a true conversion rate of 0.1, or 10%. In the real world, this true rate is hidden from us ‚Äì which is why we go and collect samples in the first place ‚Äì but in our simulation we know it is 0.1. So each time we send out ‚ÄòAnalytics200‚Äô, approximately 10% sign up.If we go out and offer 50 prospects our ‚ÄòAnalytics200‚Äô promotion we would expect, on average, to have 5 conference signups. However, we wouldn‚Äôt really be that surprised if we saw a few less or a few more. But what is a few? Would we be surprised if we saw 4? What about 10, or 25, or zero? It turns out that the P-Value answers the question, How surprising is this result?Extending this idea, rather than taking just one sample of 50 conference prospects, we take 100 separate samples of 50 prospects (so a total of 5,000 prospects, but selected in 100 buckets of 50 prospects each). After running this simulation, I plotted the results of the 100 samples (this plot is called a histogram) below:Our simulated results ranged from 2% to 20% and the average conversion rate of our 100 samples was 10.1% ‚Äì which is remarkably close to the true conversion rate of 10%.The mean (average) of repeated samples will equal the mean of the population we are sampling from.Our sample conversion rates will be distributed roughly according to a normal distribution ‚Äì this means most of the samples will be clustered around the mean andsamples far from our mean will occur very infrequently. In fact, because we know that our samples are distributed roughly normally, we can use the properties of the normal (or students-t) distribution to tell us how surprising a given result is.This is important, because while our sample conversion rate may not be exactly the true conversion rate, it is more likely to be closer to the true rate than not. In our simulated results, 53% of our samples were between 7 and 13%. This spread in our sample results is known as the sampling error.Ah, now we are cooking, but what about sample size you may be asking? We already have all of this sampling goodness and we haven‚Äôt even talked about the size of each of our individual samples. So let‚Äôs talk:There are two components that will determine how much sampling error we are going to have:We have no control over variability of the population, it is what it is.However, we can control our sample size. By increasing the sample size we reduce the error and hence can have greater confidence that our sample result is going to be close to the true mean.The spread of our samples decreases as we increase the ‚ÄòN‚Äô of each sample. The larger the sample size, the more our samples will be squished together around the true mean.For example, if we collect another set of simulated samples, but this time increase the sample size to 200 from 50, the results are now less spread out ‚Äì with a range of 5% to 16.5%, rather than from 2% to 20%. Also, notice that 84% of our samples are between 7% and 13% vs just 53% when our samples only included 50 prospects.We can think of the sample size as a sort of control knob that we can turn to increase or decrease the precision of our estimates. If we were to take an infinite number of our samples we would get the smooth normal curves below. Each centered on the true mean, but with a width (variance) that is determined by the size of each sample.The graph on the Left is more likely to be far from true mean, while the one on the right is less likely to be far from True MeanEconomics often takes a beating for not being a real science, and maybe it isn‚Äôt. However, it does make at least a few useful statements about the world. One of them is that we should expect, all else equal, that each successive input will have less value than the preceding one. This principle of diminishing returns is at play in our A/B Tests.Reading right to left, as we increase the size of our sample, our sampling error falls. However, it falls at a decreasing rate ‚Äì which means that we get less and less information from each addition to our sample.So in this particular case, moving to a sample size of 50 drastically reduces our uncertainty, but moving from 150 to 200, decreases our uncertainty by much less. Stated another way, we face increasing costs for any additional precision of our results. This notion of the marginal value of data is an important one to keep in mind when thinking about your tests. It is why it is more costly and time consuming to establish differences between test options that have very similar conversion rates. The hardest decisions to make are often the ones that make the least difference.Our test statistic, which as noted earlier, accounts for both how much difference we see between our results and for how much variably (uncertainty) we have in our data. As the observed difference goes up, our test statistic goes up. However, as the total variance goes up, our test statistic goes down.Now, without getting into more of the nitty gritty, we can think of our test statistic essentially the same way we did when we drew samples for our means. So whereas before, we were looking just at one mean, now we are looking at the difference of two means, B and A. It turns out that our three amazing sampling facts apply to differences of means as well.Whew- okay, I know that might seem like TMI, but now that we have covered the basics, we can finally tackle the p-values.Here is how it works. We collect our data for both the A/BTesting200, and Analytics200 promotions. But then we then pretend that really we ran an A/A test, rather than an A/B test. So we look at the result as if we just presented everyone with the Analytics200 promotion.Because we are sampling, we know that both groups should be centered on the same mean, and have the same variance ‚Äì remember we are pretending that both samples are really from the same population (the Analytics200 population). Since we are interested in the difference, we expect that the mean of the Analytics200-Analytics200 will be ‚Äò0‚Äô, since on average they should have the same mean.So using our three facts of sampling we can construct how the imagined A/A Test will be distributed, and we expect that our A/A‚Äô test, will on average, show no difference between each sample.However, because of the sampling error, we aren‚Äôt that surprised when we see values that are near zero, but not quite zero. Again, how surprised we are by the result is determined by how far away from zero our result is. We will use the fact that our data is normally distributed to tell us exactly how probable seeing a result away from zero is. Something way to the right of zero, like at point 3 or greater will have a low probability of occurring.The final step is to see where our test statistic falls on this distribution. If it is somewhere between -2 and 2, then that wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising to see if we were running an A/A test. However, if we see something on either side of or -2 and 2 then we start getting into fairly infrequent results.Now we place our test statistic (t-score, or z-score etc), on the A/A Test distribution. We can then see how far away it is from zero, and compare it to the probability of seeing that result if we ran an A/A Test.Here our test statistic is in the surprising region. The probability of the surprise region is the P-value. Formally, the p-value is the probability of seeing a particular result (or greater) from zero, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If ‚Äònull hypothesis is true‚Äô is tricking you up, just think instead, ‚Äòassuming we had really run an A/A‚Äô Test.If our test statistic is in the surprise region, we reject the Null (reject that it was really an A/A test). If the result is within the Not Surprising area, then we Fail to Reject the null. That‚Äôs it.Here are a few important points about p-values that you should keep in mind:So in a real sense, the conclusion of the test will depend on who is running the test. How often you are surprised is a function of how high a p-value you need to see (or relatedly, the confidence level in a Pearson-Neyman approach, eg. 95%) for when you will be ‚Äòsurprised‚Äô.We need to assume that the null is true, in order to evaluate the evidence that might suggest that we should reject the null. This is kinda of weird and an evergreen source of confusion.Nor is it telling us the probability that we will make a mistake in selecting B over A. These are both extraordinarily commons misconceptions, but they are false.This is an error that even ‚Äòexperts‚Äô often make, so now you can help it explain it to them ;-). Remember the p-value is just the probability of seeing a result or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true.While many folks in the industry will tout classical significance testing as the gold standard, this is a hot debate among data scientists.Along with Bergers‚Äô paper referenced earlier, also check out Andrew Gelman‚Äôs blog for frequent discussions around the topic.Remember that the standard error was one part variation in the actual population and one part sample size. The population variation is fixed, but there is nothing stopping us, if we are willing to ‚Äòpay‚Äô for it, to keep collecting more and more data.The question really becomes, is this result useful. Just because a result has a high p-value (or is statistically significant in the Pearson-Neyman approach) doesn‚Äôt mean it has any practical value.Look, the main thing is to sample stuff first to get an idea if it might work out. Often the hardest decisions for people to make are the ones that make the least difference. That is because it is very hard to pick a ‚Äòwinner‚Äô when the options lead to similar results, but since they are so similar it probably means there is very little up or downside to just picking one. Stop worrying about getting it right or wrong. Think of your testing program more like a portfolio investment strategy. You are trying to run the bundle of tests, whose expected additional information will give you the highest return.This is another frequent mistake. In order for all of the goodness we get from sampling that lets us interpret our p-value, you select your sample size first.Then you run the test. This could be another entire post or two, and it is a nice jumping off point for looking into the mulit-arm bandit problem. Google & my site Conductrics have very good resources on this topic.Perhaps next time.What makes all of this even more confusing is that there isn‚Äôt just one agreed upon approach to testing. For more check out Berger‚Äôs paper for a comparison of the different approaches http://www.stat.duke.edu/~berger/papers/02-01.pdf and Baiu et .al http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816758/featured image credit  Matt Gershoff Matt Gershoff is CEO of ConductricsThank you for providing such a thorough article, Matt! The real life examples and summary of takeaways make this digestible and an excellent resource for beginners who are trying to understand statistics. I have a terrible time explaining these concepts, so I definitely plan on using this as a resource. Thanks again!Hi Megan -Thanks!  Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.
Cheers!Thanks Matt for the post, it is really useful for me.Quick questions for you:
Why everybody uses conversion rate when deciding about the winner alternative in an A/B test while the main goal is revenue?
How can I use revenues instead of conversion rate?
Is there any good post explaining how to use revenues for determining the winner alternative in an A/B test?Thanks!I‚Äôd say most optimizers measure revenue in addition to conversion rate, and decide based on the revenue. Conversion rate can be a bullshit metric. Want to increase your conversion rate? Well lower all your prices by 90% and your conversion rate will go way up.Hi Diego,
Thanks for taking the time to read the post. Glad it was useful.
Good questions.  You can use revenue, or really any objective that you can assign a metric to.  The test is same ‚Äì well, technically, you might use a different test statistic, but the process and logic is all the same.
As to why most folks use conversion rates rather than revenue, my guess is that  conversion event is what is readily available on the website.   Most tools are tag based, so they tend to have limited visibility to the entire sales cycle. I would bet that companies that have home grown solutions are more likely to also use revenue. Its one of the reasons Conductrics had an API from the very beginning, so that users could plug into the website, but also fulfillment systems etc.
That said, there is also the benefit that conversion rates would tend to have lower variances than revenue, since they are bound by  {0,1} (there are also some related technical niceties of having a result bound between {0,1} when trying to prove results for multi-arm bandit algorithms).
Hope that helps! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.
Cheers, MattWow! Fantastic post. I‚Äôll be re-reading this one for awhile until it all sinks in. Really great resource. Thanks.Thanks Matt, great article.  I agree with Diego that I definitely want to use Revenue per visitor more often than conversion rates, but both can be useful.  In your example, you are showing a two-tailed test, correct?  Showing whether or not the 2 results are the same or different.  How do you feel about a 1 tailed test, used to state only whether or not an alternative option is better than the current option?Hi Matt,Awesome article. One of the most difficult things I‚Äôve dealt with is people presenting materials with the notion that the P-value definitively proves a claim but without offering details on the experiment/motivation for selecting that P-value. For some reason, A/B testing doesn‚Äôt have the token ‚Äútake this with a grain of salt‚Äù that many other tests/mechanisms for motivating a decision. As you said, those running the test can engineer ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù results if they are the ones defining significance. Most requests for clarification (i.e, asking What‚Äôs your sample size? How many samples?) is viewed as ‚Äúmath‚Äù and will put managers to sleep. All they are looking for is the ‚ÄúSignificant‚Äù stamp on a slide. As a result, it‚Äôs a common trap that I see folks attempt to spring on a regular basis. That being said, what tips do you have for those of us wanting to actually be pure for reducing bias when picking a p-value?  I realize that this will always be application specific so there‚Äôs no way to define absolutes, but are there any tricks for making sure we‚Äôre not inadvertently introducing unnecessary bias to rejecting the null hypothesis?Hi Brain,
The p-value PROVES nothing, and in fact, there is movement in the statistics and research community to even ban their use ( which BASP just did! ‚Äì see http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2015.1012991#abstract and http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/psychology-journal-bans-significance-testing/  and Andrew Gelman‚Äôs follow up discussion http://andrewgelman.com/2015/02/26/psych-journal-bans-significance-tests-stat-blogger-inundated-with-emails/)
Often what we really want is to estimate the effect size of our treatments/experiences. So we have an estimation problem, not really a testing problem.  Even if the p-value was a good stopping rule, which it isn‚Äôt, it wouldn‚Äôt tell you anything about the magnitude of the effect size. In fact, using the p-value to end your experiments can even bias the magnitude of the effect size up via what Gelman calls the Statistical Significance Filter (see: http://andrewgelman.com/2011/09/10/the-statistical-significance-filter/ ‚Äì not sure if this also holds for Wald‚Äôs SPRT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_probability_ratio_test, but I would think it would).
So just make sure you collect your data on your control/treatment/optimization variables so that you incorporate the typical traffic patterns. That way you need to sample a chunk of data first anyway., so you won‚Äôt be tempted to stop your test based on p-values. Keep in mind if results  are likely to change over and ask if your result is perishable.  Maybe all you really need is to calc , maybe use a t-score/signal noise etc. and then take some action.  My sense is that the fixation on p-values is due to an organizational fear of being held responsible for actions taken away from the status quo. There is the myth that it is a sort of the gold standard, but, it is just that, a myth.  At the end of the day, the responsibility ends with you (me, whomever) and your organization. The buck doesn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt stop with the p-value. Feel free to email me directly if you have any specific questions.Opps ‚Äì I meant ‚ÄòMaybe really all you need is to calculate the effect sizes, ‚Ä¶‚ÄôExtremely well put! I think you‚Äôre right: it all comes back to organizations be ing willing to step away from the supposed gold standards and truly understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù as well as desiring to uncover all truths rather than  just the convenient ones. Of course, that‚Äôs a considerably more difficult problem that can‚Äôt be solved with statistics alone!Awesome to hear that groups are taking steps to remove the connotation of p-values by abolishing them altogether. The question is what head will grow to replace it on the ‚Äúdamn lies‚Äù hydra‚Ä¶..Hi Matt,Thank you for the interesting article. And the mental exercise :).Overall I found it quite clear, though I did have to draw on some nearly-forgotten statistics knowledge.A couple of comments/questions:> The P-Value Is Not A Stopping Rule.
So what you‚Äôre saying here is that we should determine ahead of time where we stop sampling?And the consequence of not doing so is that we are much more likely to find a (false) significant p-value if we check in every time there is a new data point?> P-value Does Not Tell Us The Probability That B Is Better Than A.
Let‚Äôs say we are doing a two-tailed test, and when we reach our pre-determined sample size, we can see that the p-value is 0.02 (98% chance that it is not an A/A test).Based on what I understand so far, I‚Äôd agree that the p-value does not *directly* tell you the chance that B is higher than A.Correct me if I am mistaken.  But if B is higher than A, with a p-value of 0.2, the chance that the True value of B is higher than the True value of A is 99%.(with a p of 0.02, there is a 2% chance that B would be in one of the two tails of the distribution curve, thus a 1% chance it would be in any particular tail)Thank you,
NathanHi Nathan,
Phew, you get credit for reading all the way through the post ‚Äì it is a long one! So a bit of nuance, the P-value is not Prob(A=B) (or alternatively that the Prob(A-B=0)). Rather it is the Prob(data from test result, or more extreme | A=B).  So, in the Frequentest test, we don‚Äôt have a probability for B, or A, just the prob of the data given the null hypothesis.  Now you could take a Bayesian approach, and you would be able to write Prob(A) and Prob(B) (assuming binary conversion outcomes) using a Beta distribution for each, to get P(A) and P(B). Unfortunately, in the case of the Beta distribution we can‚Äôt just subtract these two and get a new beta distribution for the differences between A and B (since we want P(B-A>Precision) . So what we would then need to do is take samples from both P(A) and P(B), so A‚Äô, and B‚Äô and take the difference from our two sample values, so A‚Äô-B‚Äô=diff‚Äô.  We would then take lots of these samples to get many ‚Äòdiff‚Äô values, to get an empirical distribution over our ‚Äòdiff‚Äô values (ie use Monte Carlo sampling methods). We can then use this empirical distribution over the differences to get prob estimates.  At the end of the day, of course, there is no free lunch. After we collect data for our tests, we really only have 4 values to work with, the number of success for both A & B, and the number of failures for both A & B. No one method, all else equal, is going to magically out perform the other, given the same data and if we are asking the same type of questions of it.  Now, it is true, that if you have some good prior knowledge about what the conversion rate should be, the Bayesian approach makes is more obvious how to include that, but, on the flip side, including poor prior information will make the test take longer to reach an accurate outcome.
Hope that helps, if not you can just ping me directly.
Thanks again!

The Dutch TV show ‚ÄòDe Rekenkamer‚Äò has revealed the price of the materials used in batteries and whether more expensive batteries are worth the money. The TV show tested batteries of German discounter Lidl, Dutch retail chain Hema, widely known German battery brand and manufacturer Varta, batteries of Panasonic and the world‚Äôs most famous battery brand Duracell.For each brand the cost of four batteries was calculated, ¬†Lidl sells four batteries at ‚Ç¨0.95 / $1.30, the Hema at ‚Ç¨3.50 / $4.85, Varta batteries cost ‚Ç¨3.99 / $5.50 per four, Panasonic sells them at ‚Ç¨5.50 / $7.60 and Duracell is by far the most expensive at ‚Ç¨7.99 / $11.00 for four batteries. While Duracell is likely the best known battery brand in the world, they also come at a cost. The batteries are 8x more expensive than those of ¬†Lidl, the cheapest brand.All tested batteries were Alkaline AA, had a voltage of 1.5V but none of the batteries showed the capacity on the package.¬†The question the TV show asked is; do batteries that cost 8x times more also last 8x times longer than the cheaper ones?¬†The question was answered by Marnix Wagemaker, a battery researcher of the Technical University of Delft, the Netherlands. He tested the batteries in a camera and in a remote control. Both were specially prepared for the test, to make it possible to measure the time the batteries lasted. The results are surprising and show that more expensive batteries do not¬†necessarily¬†last longer.In the camera the Varta batteries lasted longer than the other ones, but the difference can hardly be called significant. Especially when the price of the batteries is taken in account, the least expensive battery is the best value for money by far.In the remote control, a device that consumes only a little energy each time used, the differences are also hardly noticeable, again the cheap battery is by far the best value for money. Although real world performance doesn‚Äôt differ much between the brands, by adding Ultra Power, Extra Power, High Energy and similar terms, the brands hope to convince consumers their batteries last longer.And their marketing works, when the TV show asked people on the streets they thought Ultra Ultra Power batteries would last longer than Ultra Power batteries. One person even argued that more expensive batteries resulted in better audio quality.The show also investigated the cost of the material of which each battery is made. A battery consists of a steel can, manganese dioxide for the positive electrode, zinc for the negative electrode and an¬†electrolyte. According to the TV show, the cost of the material of a battery is no more than ‚Ç¨ 0.03 / $0.04. This means that the four batteries combined cost ‚Ç¨0.12 / $0.17. Obviously this only the material, actual production costs, transportation, marketing and profit margins are not included.Last but not least, the batteries from Lidl and Varta are likely produced in the same factory. The TV show visited the only battery factory in Germany, the one that makes Varta branded ones. However as it‚Äôs the only battery factory in Germany, all batteries that state ‚Äòmanufactured in Germany‚Äô are likely coming from that factory. And guess what, that‚Äôs exactly what the package of the cheapest Lidl batteries say.Parents asked to destroy smart doll that can be used to eavesdrop on childrenFri 17 Feb 05:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffMicron 5100 MAX 960GB SATA Enterprise SSD ReviewTue 21 Feb 02:02 by JReynoldsMicrosoft silently extends support of original Windows 10 with 2 monthsThu 16 Feb 05:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffGoogle and Bing voluntarily reduce visibility of copyright infringing websites in the United KingdomMon 20 Feb 06:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffEuropean privacy watchdogs concerned about Windows 10's data collection methodsTue 21 Feb 07:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffSeveral settings at Myce.com can be changed, they are stored in cookies, which means they will be reset if you clear Myce.com cookiesChange the background to a plain color or trianglified image (similar to the default image)At Myce most social media feature are done server side and impose no privacy risk to the visitor when not used.

Routers of American consumer electronics manufacturer Belkin have severe issues connecting to the internet. The issues affect users around the globe. On Twitter many people complain to Belkin‚Äôs customer care that they are unable to connect to the internet.Read the latest news:¬†Belkin: Despite our fix, users might need to reset routerUsers also complain that the Belkin customer service by phone hangs up customers, likely because they can‚Äôt handle the load of complaints. Users that are affected see a orange or solid amber light instead of the usual color.Besides the worldwide outage of Belkin routers, also the Belkin website is down. Belkin has stated it‚Äôs aware of the issue and in the process of fixing it. The most plausible cause of the issue appears to be that the router outage is caused by the downtime of the Belkin website. Belkin¬†routers ping heartbeat.belkin.com frequently to diagnose themselves and also that URL is not reachable.Other possible causes is that the company allegedly updated the software of the routers overnight (reported by several users who were told ¬†about this by Comcast service employees) and another possible reason could be a vulnerability found in Belkin routers that‚Äôs currently exploited by cybercriminals.Update 1: Internet providers have started to send out message to their users about the issueUpdate 2: It seems all Belkin routers are affected, not limited to specific modelsUpdate 3: We continue to follow this closely, get updates on our¬†Facebook¬†/¬†Twitter¬†/¬†Google PlusUpdate 4: Possible solution: In your browser, go to¬†¬†http://192.168.2.1 . Then in¬†Dashboard go to Advanced Settings>WAN Settings>DNS> Uncheck Automatic> Change DNS to 8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4Update 5: User @LordEd reports Try a static DNS on the PC settings, not the router. Light will stay orange, but you might get Internet. Instructions are hereUpdate 6: ¬†Belkin recommends to set a static IP on the routerUpdate 7: Belkin has finally put up information on the issue, the company reports degraded performance and states:‚ÄúWe are aware of reports of an interruption to internet service when using some Belkin and Linksys routers with several internet service providers. Our team is diligently working to root cause the issue. Our call centers are also experiencing a higher than normal call rate so hold times are longer than normal.

The Dutch Voice over IP (VOIP) telecom operator Voys will move its entire operations including all 34 employees from the Netherlands to Spain for a week. With the temporary relocation the company wants to demonstrate the location independence of their cloud telephony business for which it provides the same benefits to its customers. The company will remain reachable on its local Dutch phone numbers and hopes to provide ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù to its 4000 customers.Voys is a Dutch VOIP telecom operator that mainly serves SMEs in the Netherlands but is also in the progress of expanding to other European countries. The company allows users to manage their telephony over the internet and also manages its own operations in ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù.In case of Voys that means it‚Äôs able to connect new customers, bill them, access Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software and provide support all in the cloud and/or over the internet. Also the software to provide the telephone service can be accessed from any remote location and the company is nearly paperless.To demonstrate to their customers how well that works, the entire company today moved 1500 Km ¬†to a house in Spain for a week , where all 34 employees will live and work together. The company promises its customers that they won‚Äôt be aware of the move, the telecom operator will provide business as usual. The entire relocation has a single point of failure however, the connection with the internet.To make the relocation possible, preparations started in 2012, when the idea first came up. Desktop computers of all employees were gradually replaced by laptops and a project was started. Several requirements were set, as much employees as possible should be able to participate in the relocation, the location for a week had to have nice weather, it should be within the same timezone and the location should have a solid internet connection.After searching for a while, the company picked ¬†Girona, a city close to Barcelona in Spain, known for great weather circumstances and close to many popular European holiday destinations. All employees could take a direct flight to Girona from an airport close to the Voys‚Äô office and stay in a villa suitable to host 40 people.The location didn‚Äôt have a sufficient internet connection and therefor the company decided to use internet by satellite. Today the relocation takes place and the company hopes to demonstrate that indeed their cloud telephony service is really location independent.Parents asked to destroy smart doll that can be used to eavesdrop on childrenFri 17 Feb 05:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffMicron 5100 MAX 960GB SATA Enterprise SSD ReviewTue 21 Feb 02:02 by JReynoldsMicrosoft silently extends support of original Windows 10 with 2 monthsThu 16 Feb 05:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffGoogle and Bing voluntarily reduce visibility of copyright infringing websites in the United KingdomMon 20 Feb 06:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffEuropean privacy watchdogs concerned about Windows 10's data collection methodsTue 21 Feb 07:02 by Jan Willem AldershoffSeveral settings at Myce.com can be changed, they are stored in cookies, which means they will be reset if you clear Myce.com cookiesChange the background to a plain color or trianglified image (similar to the default image)At Myce most social media feature are done server side and impose no privacy risk to the visitor when not used.

71,7651506,Top 20+ change management mistakes to avoid,http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/change-management/top-20-change-management-mistakes-to-avoid/,2014,"Driving and managing change will remain the number one priority for leaders according to a published study.But the reality is that most change efforts fail. Many of these failures can be traced to these common change management mistakes:Pressure to act quickly undermines values and culture. Leaders take drastic steps quickly with no time to explore alternatives. Values about participation, involvement, or concern for people disappear. Cynicism grows.The best change program in the world won‚Äôt do any good if your organization doesn‚Äôt have a strategy for getting where it wants to go.All too often organizations announce big changes and new programs with big events and fanfare, but then very little actually happens.The initial energy and enthusiasm fades, specific changes are never identified let alone implemented, results aren‚Äôt realized, managers don‚Äôt adjust, or maybe something even better comes along leading to a new ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù with new fanfare.Journalists dig for information, and items can run in the media before employees hear about them. Middle managers look dumb and uninformed. Employees feel insulted and left out.What is obvious to the top may not be so obvious to other pivotal players. How real and meaningful is the case for change for each of the pivotal groups? Do they feel a sense of crisis, a ‚Äúburning platform?‚Äù If not, how can you create it?Failure to create a strong sense of urgency causes a change movement to lose momentum before it gets a chance to start. Establishing a true sense of urgency without creating an emergency is the first objective achieved to overcome the routine of daily business.Organizational change will be extremely difficult in most cases if managers rely only on making a case to the rational, analytical, problem-solving side of the brain. Instead, they must also make an emotional case for change and align the rational and emotional elements of the appeal.Before you can get buy-in, people need to feel the problem. People aren‚Äôt going to consider anything until they are convinced there is a problem that truly needs to be addressed.Managing resistance to change is challenging and it‚Äôs not possible to be aware of all sources of resistance to change.Expecting that there will be resistance to change and being prepared to manage it is a proactive step. It‚Äôs far better to anticipate objections than to spend your time putting out fires, and knowing how to overcome resistance to change is a vital part of any change management plan.One of the biggest mistakes you can make in initiating major company changes is to expect that everyone‚Äôs reaction will be even remotely like yours.Regardless of the catalyst for the change, it will be your employees who determine whether it successfully achieves its desired outcome. Organizations don‚Äôt change ‚Äì People do ‚Äì or they don‚Äôt.Change management communications need to be targeted to each segment of the workforce, and delivered in a two-way fashion that allows people to make sense of the change subjectively.To many leaders focus too much on management and too little on leadership. That is mainly because managers are taught to use management tools, of which many exist.Leadership, on the other hand, is hard to teach, springing as it does from many personal qualities. And, compared to the great quantity of management tools, few leadership tools are available to the manager. One of the few ‚Äì and one of the most effective ‚Äì is storytelling.All change in organizations is challenging, but perhaps the most daunting is changing culture.When people in an organization realize and recognize that their current organizational culture needs to transform to support the organization‚Äôs success and progress, change can occur.Organizations usually have networks and coalitions of people that are not visible on the formal organization chart. These networks and coalitions help shape opinion. They can either accelerate or retard change. Ignoring or circumventing these groups can result in actual resistance.Leaders must actively involve the people most affected by the change in its implementation. This will help ensure employees at all levels of the organization embrace the proposed changes.Structural and systems changes help create a new context and orientation. And they have the surface appeal of being visible and fast. But people do not become different just because you put them in a new context. Structures and systems, by themselves, don‚Äôt change people‚Äôs behavior or give them new skills.Creating a higher level of performance, lowering cost, raising quality, carving out a new relationship to the market always requires a mix of decisions and behavior change. Decisions concern such things as market position, alliances, and product lines.Behavior change asks people to act differently, gain new skills, or shift the organization‚Äôs culture.Getting people to change their behavior requires a different mindset and a different set of leadership skills than making decisions about strategy.Change does not happen through goals and exhortation alone. Like any business operation, it also calls for the right skills and resources. Organizations often simply fail to commit the necessary time, people, and resources to making change work.Paradoxically, successful behavior change often demands the very skills the change is trying to create.Large-scale organizational change is a long process. Break down your vision into smaller short-term goals, and communicate short-term successes at each opportunity.An important part of sticking to the vision is to create opportunities to achieve smaller goals along the way. These small successes will not only work directly toward achieving the desired change, but will create positive feelings of accomplishment and the drive to pursue the next goal.When a major change effort gets under way, executives often are scared off by the symptoms of their success.¬† Don‚Äôt panic if you see problems vis-√†-vis morale, job stress, loyalty, the trust level or job satisfaction.¬† It could be proof that you‚Äôre doing precisely the right things.If you declare victory too soon, the focus will be taken away from your efforts, and all traces of your hard work could soon disappear. Successful companies consistently re-evaluate their change efforts to determine where other areas can be improved, such as employee development and retention, new projects and new systems and structures.Achieving fundamental change in an organization is at least a 2 to 3 year process. But organizations often run out of energy or lose focus after 9 to 15 months.Doing things again the same way as you did before when even then they didn‚Äôt work properly.Short URL & title:

If you enjoyed this article, please take 5 seconds to share it on your social network. Thanks!Torben RickExperienced senior executive, both at a strategic and operational level, with strong track record in developing, driving and managing business improvement, development and change management. International experience from management positions in Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.The practicality and simplicity of the outlined change management mistakes is most appreciated! Thank you!I like your list. But I would add something to Mistake 7 Not Dealing Proactively with Resistance. I agree with your advice, but I don‚Äôt believe that resistance has to go with the territory. People don‚Äôt have to go through stages of grief if the change is handled well. In Collins‚Äô book, good to Great, he discusses great organizations that are so good at keeping people in the loop regarding goals, threats, opportunities, etc. that major changes often were planned, implemented, and got results without significant resistance. Too often leaders miss the importance of pre-planning so that every stakeholder can see 9and feel) why a change is needed.I couldn‚Äôt agree more on point# 8. I would rather think, the challenge may vary from complete lack of communication to lack of change communication to appropriate impacted parties at detailed level as needed. Also, i have noticed that it is critical, especially on large scale transformation efforts to have an exclusive change manager or a Management of Change lead. When change management is left to the project managers, it often becomes a deliverable rather than a component that drives the change within the organization.
¬†
I enjoyed reading this post. I would like to invite you to take time to review my consulting blog if you find it interesting (www.thesmartconsultant.com). Your time and inputs are appreciated.Hi Rick, I like your list also, after having read through the list ‚Äì I think number 7 need to be addressed further.
Most companies totally ignore the fact that most people have history from previous change projects/processes, god and bad, this will influence on how they accept the change process to be. Furthermore we need to look at their current mental state (Stress on workplace, at home etc.) you could call it the personal stamina towards change) and then we have to look at how they imagine the future after the change process has taken place ‚Äì is it attractive enough and does the change process insure the right level of involvement and influence on their own job situation). This altogether will if discovered prior to the large change processes, give the organization a huge advantage towards avoiding failure.

Also we need to consider the fact that not all have a negative reaction to change and that it is individually on how fast one person slide through the phase in the graph ‚Äì the positive reaction to change ‚Äì because if we don‚Äôt, we risk losing some important people on the way towards achieving the new stage. These people will be the strong ones that can‚Äôt see themselves in the ‚Äúnew tomorrow‚Äù and therefore will leave the organization.Hi Rick, thank you for sharing list.  Number 18 particularly.  This would be useful for a number of senior leaders.  As Egan clearly states ‚Äúmanaging the shadow side of organisations‚Äù  sometimes there is a public agenda and a different agenda underpinning so kpi‚Äôs differ.  It is also refreshing to see that there are people who do not see a drop in morale during a big change as a negative!  Thank you.Rick,
Thank you for sharing this list and being brave enough to accept feedback and comments.
¬†
With regard to #12:¬†Not involving the employees.
You write about involving the employees in the IMPLEMENTATION phase.
¬†
The most overlooked opportunity in change management is the involvement of the employees in the INVESTIGATION of performance problems and developping new programs/methods (either through incremental change or radical change based on ‚Äúgreen fielding‚Äù) TOGETHER with the employees.
¬†
In many situations the need for change is driven by top management due to lackluster performance, and most of the management layers below are not driving the change (because they often lack the knowledge, which the employees have, to know HOW they can dramatically improve the performance), but instead middle management is often only trying to reduce the impact of the change that is forced upon them.
¬†
In other words, I often see that the top decides HOW we are going to change, instead of setting PERFORMANCE objectives and involving the rest of the organisation on how this should be done.Great list Torben, thanks. ¬†Too any organizations not realizing the difference between change management and project management, the outcome of which is that they simply automate their inefficiencies and problems they don‚Äôt fix them, certainly not long term, good piece on change versus project management¬†Nice checklist (and could be used as one).  Great synopsis.  Along with other comments on #7 and #8, I would like to expand on those numbers. I would add ‚ÄòNot giving employee‚Äôs and out‚Äô and/or not allowing some areas to ‚Äòback door‚Äô the original process.  If a change is not realistic, or you have a high priority project I have found people find ways to work around changes being made. It might be a tool, it might be a process, it might be both.  If excuses are made, by example ‚Äòthis is a strategic project‚Äô, or we don‚Äôt require this vendor to change‚Ä¶ it diminishes the potential success.  This may not always be an option, especially if a vendor contract is involved, however it should be monitored and encouraged as soon as possible.Good article. Thank you!Good list; thank you. I‚Äôd add to your first point: Not to start too early, either. Beginning change without the commitment and critical mass of the most senior stakeholders affected by the change can often lead to difficulties and demotivation later.Thanks Rick for posting a valuable article and also for stimulating a valuable discussion. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with Ian.  Change leadership requires a specific skill set that is quite different from the project management skills.  Fully utilizing the Change Manager‚Äôs talent, tools, and processes may seem tedious at first.  But using a consistent process is an investment in success because at the end of the day, every improvement or innovation is dependent on people being willing to adopt the changes required.Torben, thank you for this wonderful share. I especially resonated with ‚ÄòThe Change Curve‚Äô. It will help me a great deal with some clients I am working with.Please enable JavaScript to submit this form.

Given that it only launched a few weeks ago, it‚Äôs receiving an extraordinary amount of buzz. So, what is it, and why all the fuss? This post will tell you exactly what the Meerkat app is, and show you 3 ways to use it for your business.What is the Meerkat app?First things first: Meerkat is an app that lets you live-tweet video right from your iPhone or iPad. Instead of having to record a video and then tweet it, your Twitter followers can actually be watching you LIVE ‚Äì meaning you can share breaking news or live events as they happen.The Meerkat website outlines the following ‚Äòrules‚Äô for its use:‚ÄúEverything that happens on Meerkat happens on Twitter.¬†Streams will be pushed to followers in real time via push notifications.¬†People can only watch it live. No reruns.¬†Watchers can restream any stream to their followers in real time.¬†Scheduled streams will be distributed in the community by their subscribers.¬†Your own streams can be kept locally on your phone, but never on the cloud.¬†Everyone can watch on web.¬†Be kind.‚ÄùWhile the app got off to a great start, Meerkat received an incredible blow¬†when Twitter cut off Meerkat‚Äôs ability to import connections. So while Meerkat users can still let their Twitter followers know they are live-streaming, those followers will not automatically be notified.In spite of this, Meerkat has great potential as a way to reach your Twitter followers when it really matters.We are only in the early days of Meerkat, but I can already see a few potential uses for the app for business.Become a roving reporter by live-streaming industry events to your Twitter followers. Recording videos and then sharing them is great, but sharing events AS they happen? Even better.Live-stream from conferences, trade shows, or meetups, and let your followers feel like they are in on the action. Interview speakers or experts, or ‚Äòmeerkast‚Äô behind-the-scenes happenings.USA Today reported that Meerkat live-casting was alive and well at last week‚Äôs SXSW, with industry gurus like Brian Solis streaming about the event using the platform. Just imagine what you can do with it!The next time you launch a product, live-stream it to your followers, and invite them to take part in the excitement. And the fact that live-streams are not saved on Twitter ‚Äì they disappear once they are done ‚Äì means more potential for live, ‚Äòas it happens‚Äô engagement. This may mean more excitement, more views and more buzz for your products and brand.Imagine watching LIVE news and announcements on Twitter as-it-happens? Instead of being sent off-site to watch a video that was recorded an hour ago, you can watch events in real time. While this will be a powerful tool for news outlets, I can also see businesses using Meerkat to share breaking industry news of interest to their followers.I hope this post has given you some insight into what the Meerkat app is, and how you can use it for your business.¬† I am sure I will have lots more to share about this amazing new app in the coming weeks and months, but hopefully this post will give you some ideas to get you started!Have you tried out the Meerkat app? What do you think? Share below!¬†Filed Under: Social Media Alisa Meredith saysMarch 24, 2015 at 12:18 pmThanks, Kim! I‚Äôm looking forward to trying this at SMMW AND to meeting you! I‚Äôm torn because I love the live option but I wish I could watch and share again later. Then again, I love that it doesn‚Äôt take up space on my phone! Kim Garst saysMarch 31, 2015 at 10:39 amHave you tried Periscope? Jon-David saysMarch 24, 2015 at 2:36 pmHi Kim, my twitter friend! I am salivating for this tool. I would have used it at last weekend‚Äôs beauty convention in Chicago. But, I‚Äôm a Droid user, and Meerkat is only for iPhone and iPad. Is this correct? I would certainly love to know when Meerkat App will be available to us non-Apple peeps. Kim Garst saysMarch 31, 2015 at 10:31 amHave you tried the new Periscope app? Owned by Twitter and does the same thing üôÇ Yasmine saysMarch 24, 2015 at 4:31 pmI have seen their ads everywhere but got no time to see what is that. Thank you for the post üôÇ very informative as usual. Look what Yasmine just posted..top-10-mistakes-in-social-media Kim Garst saysMarch 31, 2015 at 10:31 amThanks Yasmine! Genevieve Kohn saysMarch 25, 2015 at 6:35 pmGreat article. Do you know if Meerkat has any plans to also feature their app on Android? Thank you for this useful information.

73,9548367,3 Ways to Make Your B2B Brand Break the Content Mold,http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/05/b2b-break-content-mold/,2015,"I‚Äôve got a confession to make.As a content writer for a number of B2B clients I‚Äôve been coasting ‚Äì cruising through e-books, white papers, and infographics with the same tone of voice.This hasn‚Äôt been due to writer‚Äôs block, laziness, or even my own choosing. Rather, it‚Äôs been what the client has wanted ‚Ä¶ Safe. Clean. Boring.And, as you know, the client gets what the client wants.There‚Äôs nothing wrong with safe, clean copy. It serves a purpose. In marketing, clarity and simplicity of message are paramount ‚Äì but I just can‚Äôt help thinking there‚Äôs got to be more.At the heart of good content marketing is good content. At the heart of good content is good writing. At the heart of good writing is compelling, irresistibly persuasive tone. So why does so much B2B copy sound the same?There‚Äôs no reason for B2B brands to be boring. Sure, they might have a smaller, more select audience, and write about niche topics, but that‚Äôs no excuse for content that doesn‚Äôt engage or excite.The abbreviation B2B¬† doesn‚Äôt help. Business-to-business marketing isn‚Äôt what it purports to be. Nobody actually sells to a business ‚Äì we‚Äôre always selling to people. The truth is that all B2B marketing is B2C marketing because ultimately, everyone is a consumer.B2B professionals are just consumers who happen to have niche technical knowledge or corporate need. Much like a B2C audience, they buy into brands that communicate clear benefits and leave a lasting emotive impression.So how can B2B content marketing be less bland AND more brand?The truth is that B2B marketing is overwhelmingly in need of systemic overhaul ‚Ä¶ and one blog post isn‚Äôt going to fix that. But there are three ways in which B2B companies can start to develop interesting and provocative brand voices that will resonate with audiences, create brand evangelists, and encourage consumers through the sales funnel.She who dares wins.Doing something different can be risky ‚Äì but it‚Äôs the only way that B2B brands can expect to be heard in an increasingly crowded market. This doesn‚Äôt mean that B2B brands should go down the gimmicky route with cheap gags and promotional ploys.Content marketing is not about attention for attention‚Äôs sake ‚Äì it needs to be the right kind of attention, from the right kind of audience. Any form of consumer outreach should center on a clear message of benefits arising from use of the B2B product.However, a fear of losing key messaging around product capabilities often keeps B2B brands in the boring zone.Compelling content and clear product messaging are not mutually exclusive. You really can have both. A particularly striking example of this is SunGard‚Äôs zombie-attack infographic:The graphic communicates core information around cloud migration with style. An example like this works because¬†:Calculated risk-taking really can pay off.It‚Äôs the trust part with which B2B brands seem to struggle. In-house marketers know¬† the brands that they represent exceptionally well; the creatives hired by in-house marketers know¬†¬†the industry exceptionally well. This necessarily means a bit of give and take.If B2B brands want to distinguish themselves from others, they need to be open to fresh ideas and suggestions from expert creatives.This is easier said than done of course. Not all creatives are created equal ‚Äì and the same goes for their advice. Furthermore, in-house marketers will be held to account on a particular marketing effort‚Äôs perceived success. It‚Äôs understandable for B2B brands to want to hedge their bets by pushing for safe, conservative content.However, the end result is inevitably a spate of mediocre work. Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. B2B brands serious about differentiating themselves will afford creative resources the room to maneuver, seeing them as more than pen holders and graphic designers. They will move away from quashing the advice of professional copywriters and artists, and even give them the benefit of the doubt on occasion.Nominated for best use of creative in the B2B Marketing Awards 2014, John McNeil Studio‚Äôs work for Juniper Networks shows what happens when creativity is allowed to flourish.As stated by Picasso and echoed by Steve Jobs, ‚Äúgood artists copy, great artists steal.‚Äù¬†To copy is merely to imitate. But to steal is to appropriate ‚Äì to take that which has been successful elsewhere and make it your own. Any English student will tell you that the greatest writers are the greatest thieves (i.e., Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton).The takeaway for B2B brands is to explore the content marketing efforts around them. Which companies are producing arresting content? Which brands can be identified easily by their tone of voice and written style alone?And then get to stealing.Get to the root of why some content marketing stands head and shoulders above the rest, and integrate these conceptual nuggets of insight into your unique offering as a brand.B2B brands can look at great copywriting within their own sector for a start ‚Ä¶ but they shouldn‚Äôt stop there. It‚Äôs worth exploring the B2C world too. As an innately more creativity-led sphere, it‚Äôs a real treasure trove of ideas for compelling copy and content.One example of this is WorldPay‚Äôs Unusual Suspects anti-fraud game, which shows clever B2B ‚Äúappropriation‚Äù of a tried-and-tested B2C technique. Interactive games and quizzes have long been part of B2C marketing and WorldPay takes advantage of this approach, targeting B2B decision-makers in a fun, fresh way.How do you think B2B brands can work to avoid sounding the same?Continue to break the boring content marketing mold and make plans today to attend Content Marketing World 2015.

Nicole Papadopoulos, the director of Online Centric, has been disqualified from managing a corporation until March 1, 2021.The court found both Papadopoulos and Online Centric breached the Australian Consumer Law. Consumer Affairs Victoria said in a statement the company and Papadopoulos have also been ordered to close the company‚Äôs website and pay costs of $1700.Rohan Harris, principal at law firm Russell Kennedy, told SmartCompany the provisions in Australian Consumer Law that deal with this kind of conduct are an extension of laws that prohibit companies from making false or misleading representations.And while Online Centric has not been fined in this case, Harris says closing down a business is ‚Äúin many cases ‚Ä¶ a more effective remedy than fining someone‚Äù.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pretty clear-cut case and the court has shut down the business as a result,‚Äù Harris says.Consumer Affairs has not indicated if individual customers were left out of pocket as a result of Online Centric‚Äôs conduct and Harris says this may have also been a factor in the court‚Äôs decision not to fine the company.But Harris says the decision has broad ramifications for Papadopoulos, who has not only had her business shut down but also her ability to conduct other businesses.‚ÄúIt will limit what she can do in the future,‚Äù he says.Harris says the case should serve as a warning for small businesses who may have worked with Online Centric in the past, as well as those who may be tempted to bend the rules.‚ÄúSome directors think they can just go and start up another business, but that‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù he says.SmartCompany contacted Papadopoulos but did not receive a response prior to publication.Eloise Keating is the editor of SmartCompany.

77,9609506,Lesser known C features,http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/~holub/c_features.html,2015,"There are many C features which are lesser known even to experienced programmers.Do not be confused with dynamic arrays. C99 supports arrays of variable length where the size is calculated at run-time while processing the array definition. This is a back-port from C++ and far better than the alloca function. Have a look at the example below.It is not possible to skip the definition using break in switch statement. Arrays with unspecified size are used in structures to help addressing data past the structure end.There are several restrictions. The flexible array member must be the last element of the structure and the structure itself must be neither used in another structure definition nor as a member of an array.In old C the fields of a structure have to be in fixed order during initialization. It is a well-known GNU extension that specifies structure fields with the label-like syntax. C99 has a new approach using the . operator. Although it looks strange, it has a hidden meaning (see below).It is not very well known that an array initiator may jump in index like in the enumeration definition.Note that already initialized fields may be overwritten.Compounds literals bring a new method of assigning to structures and passing structures as parameters.Yes, C has inline functions. Like in C++ prepend the function header with the inline keyword (__inline__ in headers). Note that certain constructions may disallow the compiler to inline the function. Especially constructions implemented on stack like variadic parameters, alloca or variable sized arrays.Have a look at the example below - there are two functions each executed in a separate thread with the same pointer as a parameter. Do you think that the check function must terminate?No, it doesn't have to. The incrementation may by optimized. Below is a disassembled code produced by GCC -O1:As we can see, *i has been replaced by the edx register, which is written only at the beginning and at the end of the cycle. The value of *i switches between 0 and 10, and never becomes 5. Marking the pointer as volatile will solve the problem. The semantics is that a volatile object may change its value outside the scope of local execution and thus every read and write access has to be processed immediately without any optimizations. Focus on this problem when you observe different behavior across different optimization levels. It is not guaranteed that a read or write access even on volatile objects are atomic.The freedom of pointers in C leads sometimes to slower code. The programmer can enable several optimizations by guarantying that objects referred by pointers do not overlap.Both functions copy one block of chars into another. In copy2 the compiler may use word addressing instructions to speedup the execution. But when blocks overlap the behavior is undefined.The syntax is similar to functions. Parameters in ... are then addressed as __VA_ARGS__ (variable argument).This may looks like a joke, but it is not. All occurrences of sequences ??<, ??>, ??(, ??), ??=, ??/, ??!, ??', ??- in a source file are converted to one of characters { } [ ] # / | ^ ~. So don't be surprised...As an aside, tokens <: :> <% %> %: behave as [ ] { } # and ## (but the conversion is not performed in strings).Have a look at the header file stdint.h. There are typedefined types like (where N is in { 8, 16, 32, 64})Unsigned variants have prefix ""u"".Be careful when using printf functions. Since you do not know which C type are behind these typedefs, you have to use predefined constants from inttypes.h. Constants starts with PRI followed by type character (one of diouxX), modificator LEAST or FAST or nothing, and number of bits. For example, 32 bit fast integer would take the form PRIdFAST32.C still does not have a boolean type, but reserves an integer type _Bool big enough to store 0 and 1. The header file stdbool.h only typedefines _Bool as a bool and defines constants false as 0 and true as 1.This is not C++ bool!C has three complex types: {float, double, long double} _Complex. In the header file complex.h _Complex is typedefined to complex. Complex types may be not implemented in freestanding (without OS) implementations."
78,9628921,Hellbanning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning,2015,"Stealth banning (also called shadow banning, hell banning or ghost banning[1]) is the act of blocking a user from an online community in such a way that the user does not realise that they have been banned. By making a problem user's contributions invisible (or less prominent) to other members of the service, the hope is that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site.[2][3][1] [4] If the user never becomes aware that they were banned, it will not occur to them to attempt to circumvent that ban. The system is a more complex example of the ""don't feed the troll"" approach to community management.[4]Comment ghosting (or selective invisibility) is the practice of rendering an individual comment invisible to everyone except the poster, in order to eliminate disruption it might otherwise cause.[3] Stealth banning is sometimes also called ""Coventry"" or ""ghost-posting"".An early form of stealth banning has been found in the mid-1980s Citadel BBS software, which had a ""problem user bit"".[4] When enabled, the user would still be able to read public discussions, but any messages posted by that user would be automatically rerouted to a different ""twit room"" discussion instead.[5]Michael Pryor of Fog Creek Software described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system FogBugz, ""to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone"". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in flame wars, the system also discouraged spammers, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place.[2] The Verge describes it as ""one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book"", noting that early versions of vBulletin had a global ignore list known as ""Tachy goes to Coventry"".[6]A 2012 update to Hacker News introduced a system of ""hellbanning"" for spamming and abusive behavior.[7][8]Craigslist has also been known to ""ghost"" a user's individual ads; and reportedly entire accounts.[9][10][11] Reportedly, an ad is placed and confirmation is sent that it has been posted; the ad may be viewed in the user's account, but, if ghosted, will fail to show up in the live listings.In 2017 Twitter implemented a similar ""timeout"" feature where accounts could be temporarily restricted such that only their followers could read their message, although this restriction was announced to the user.[6]A variant of stealth banning is ""slowbanning"", where problem users have loading delays introduced into every page they visit on the site, in the hope that their participation will be reduced.[4] A similar variation is ""errorbanning"", when the problem user is served fake error messages at random as they browse the site.[4]"

Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page will serve as President and CEO respectively, giving the way for Sundar Pichai to be appointed as Google CEO. Now, Pichai makes his first major round of promotions and appointments as CEO. These changes mostly concert the ads and Android units, which Google hopes will bring in more of the profits to the company.Neal Mohan is currently the vice president of display and advertising, but will now be promoted to Senior Vice President. He has been a powerful figure in Silicon Valley and such major players as Twitter and Dropbox have attempted to lure them over to their side, only for Mohan to stay at the tech giant. The display ad and video businesses of Google will be a huge force in Google, despite the fact that the company reorganization means search and related products will be the main focus of the company. Mohan is heavily involved in display ads and YouTube business, so this will be a challenge for him.Another major promotion is for Hiroshi Lockheimer, who is a VP for the Android team. He will now assume the responsibility for SVP for Android, Chrome OS, and Chomecast. He has been a mainstay at Google since 2006 and is in fact, one of the closest people to Pichai, back when he was handling Android and Chrome only. Now he will continue to take on more responsibilities for Android, which he has been doing anyways since the reorganization.Philip Schindler is now the SVP of Global Sales and Operations, after being an ads VP for some time now. There are also other slew of Google promotions to VP titles, as Pichai attempts to stave off competition, particularly from digital rivals like Facebook, Twitter who are also focusing on ads and commerce.VIA: ReCode"

First they changed their name, now they‚Äôve changed their logo. Google introduced a new sans-serif and slightly toned-down four-colour logo on Tuesday in the biggest redesign since 1999.Google said the new design would soon be seen across all its products. Google‚Äôs homepage introduced the redesign with an animation that wiped away the old logo and drew the new one.‚ÄúGoogle has changed a lot over the past 17 years ‚Äì from the range of our products to the evolution of their look and feel. And today we‚Äôre changing things up once again,‚Äù the company said in a blogpost.The company said the redesign was meant to reflect the way that people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt simply tell you that you‚Äôre using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you. For example, new elements like a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you‚Äôre talking, tapping or typing. Meanwhile, we‚Äôre bidding adieu to the little blue ‚Äòg‚Äô icon and replacing it with a four-color ‚ÄòG‚Äô that matches the logo.‚ÄùThe logo has undergone many, mainly small, changes in its history. The colours have changed, 3D letters have been flattened, and an exclamation point came and went in 1999. The move comes just a month after a major restructuring of the company was unveiled. Google is now owned by Alphabet, a holding company created by founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to separate their money-making search engine company from the loss-making, ‚Äúmoon shot‚Äù projects like robot cars, medical research and internet-delivering balloons."

Involuntarily seated in the front row of the comedy club, I‚Äôm forced to witness it all up-close. He begins his set with some sexist jokes, accompanied by a couple racist impersonations. I smile and laugh at every punchline just to be polite; however, he isn‚Äôt satisfied.He berates me for not laughing enough. I lie and tell him I‚Äôm enjoying the show. He continues to make rude remarks and ask antagonistic questions. I answer affably and wait for him to start his act.Ten minutes later, he‚Äôs still talking to me. I feel sorry for him. I do stand up comedy myself. It takes courage to stand on stage and try to make people laugh‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially if you‚Äôre not funny.Finally, he pauses to do a misogynistic bit about how ‚Äúevery girl on Tinder is a dumb, ugly slut.‚ÄùSoon, he starts talking to me again. ‚ÄúAre you single?‚Äù I nod my head. He points at my female friend. ‚ÄúSo she‚Äôs a prostitute, right?‚ÄùNo one laughs. Before I can respond, he asks: ‚ÄúWhy do you think you‚Äôre single?‚Äù I smile and reply: ‚ÄúBecause your mother won‚Äôt commit to me.‚ÄùEveryone in the audience laughs louder than at any point in his act. His face falls. He waits for the laughs to subside, then asks the worst conceivable question:‚ÄúHow could You ever get my mom?‚ÄùFor him, the comedy is over. The entire club is silent. He doesn‚Äôt know how well he‚Äôs set me up. I have to finish him:‚ÄúI found her on Tinder!‚ÄùThe audience erupts with its biggest laugh of the night, complete with cheers and applause. The spotlight shows every bit of arrogance escape from his eyes.Alex Marshi is an American writer and nomad. Bylines include Rolling Stone and Port magazine. Read and recommend his latest story.

83,9156316,Combining the power of R and D3.js,http://blog.ae.be/combining-the-power-of-r-and-d3-js/,2015,"According to wikipedia, the amount of unstructured data might account for more than 70%-80% of all data in organisations. Because everyone wants to find hidden treasures in these mountains of information, new tools for processing, analyzing and visualizing data are being developed continually.This post focuses on data processing with R and visualization with the D3 JavaScript library.When using R for data processing, there are a couple of options to produce graphics within R itself. One of them is to use the R package called 'ggplot2'. This package makes it easy to turn data into beautiful charts. Consider the following chart, produced with ggplot.As you can see, there is a lot of data on this plot, which makes it difficult to see what the values are at a specific point in time. Zooming in is not an option, because it's a static png-image. If we want more detail for a more specific time period to fit on the chart, we have to run our ggplot-scripts again with a smaller data set, which is not a flexible way of visualizing data.When it comes to data processing, R is an excellent choice. When it comes to producing slick graphics, R is still a good option. But when you want to take data visualization to a higher level, you should start looking in other directions. That's where the D3 JavaScript library comes in.To combine D3 with R, again you have a couple of options. It depends on whetherThese two options are both valid if you have one-way communication (from R to a webpage with JavaScript). However, if you want two-way communication, meaning you can rerun R scripts based on input from a web application, you'll need other solutions like a Shiny webserver, or Rserve integrated with a webserver, or other types of interfaces. Two-way communication is beyond the scope of this post, so let's examine the one-way communication options.Let's try option number 1 first. We already showed how to use ggplot. Using R and the package gridSVG, the plot (with all it's data attached) can be transformed into an SVG element. Afterwards, we can start binding javascript to individual elements within the SVG. And here is the result.Hover over the 'interpolated' points to see the tooltip. The process which leads to this result (explained here) requires a lot of manual work. We have to look inside the SVG code, to find the names of classes and id's where we can bind our javascript on. And that's only the binding. Again, this is not a very flexible approach.There is a solution to this problem, and that is Plotly.Plotly is built on D3 and they have done all that binding work for you. They offer multiple API's that not only work with R, but also with Python, Matlab, NodeJS and Excel. They also have an API especially for ggplot users, which makes it easy to extend our previous example. It works by uploading your ggplot (which also contains your data) to a repository on their servers. Afterwards, all D3 binding is done and you get a fully interactive plot that you can embed in any webpage:As a side note, you can't use the full spectrum of the D3 library with Plotly. It's only suitable for 'basic' charts and plots.Next, option number 2. Let's use R and Javascript for what they're both good at. R does the processing and delivers the data, which is used as input for JavaScript visualization.To illustrate this, we start from scratch with a new example. We will be going through the 3 basic steps in data science.Number 1 & 2 are done in R, while number 3 is done in JavaScript. We'll be using data from this blog site itself to demonstrate this principle.Looking at the html-page which contains all the info, we see that each row in the table has an author, a title, multiple tags, multiple categories, and a publication date. We can identify relationships between these entities. A good way to visualize relational data with D3 is the D3 bundle layout. If we want to use this type of visualization, we need to know in what format our data should be. We can see in the D3 code example where the data comes from: a JSON-file, which contains all relations between different elements, grouped by the type of element. Armed with this knowledge, we can start evaluating the 3 basic steps.We get the data by scraping the html page which contains an overview of all blog posts. The blog-data in this webpage is structured in an html-table. R has packages which enable you to easily scrape the data from such a table. First we save this page as a static html page, so we can parse it more easily.The code looks something like this.[code language=""r""] library(XML)# read all html table elements raw <- readHTMLTable(""WordPress.html"")# ours is the first of two tables # in the html document data <- raw[[1]] [/code]Step 1 is done. We got our data. Next up is cleaning the data and storing it in the right format. We can determine the 'right format' by looking at the D3 code example. A JSON-file is used as data-input for the visualisation. This JSON-file should contain all relations, for each single element. The end result should look something like this:[code language=""javascript""] [ { name: ""Title.But do you love it?"", size: 0, imports: [ ""Author.Roman Verraest"", ""Categorie.Business Consulting"", ""Tag.AE Foyer"", ""Date.2014-12"", ""Tag.Business Architecture"", ""Tag.Customer Journey"", ""Categorie.Enterprise Architecture"" ] }, { ... [/code]To achieve this result, we can use R to reorganize the data. R has some packages that can help us achieve this. For example, the package 'reshape' helps to reorganize tabular data, or the package 'RJSONIO' which serializes R objects to JSON. After some more R magic, the data is cleaned and in the right format.This JSON-file, containing all data, is accessed by D3 as follows:[code language=""javascript""] d3.json(""input.json"",function(err,classes) { ... }); [/code]Simply plugging this data into this code example gives us the final end-result: a fully interactive D3 graphic (screenshot below). Move the mouse over the text to see all relations among the different entities.There is still much more to be said when it comes to integrating R and D3. This post just scratches the surface. Projects like rCharts and clickme or visualizing ggplots with Shiny and D3 are all different approaches to combining R and D3. Topics:

85,8632913,How GitHub Writes and Communicates Project Spec Documents,https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/615,2014,"As an engineer, I've watched your talks with great interest - you've had some great insights into the culture at GitHub, along with how you guys cut code & manage deployments.
I'm curious to know how you manage the less technical side of software development at GitHub.
Who writes Marketing Requirements Documents, Product Requirement Documents, Functional specs and eventually (..finally?!) Tech Specs?
Does anybody write the aforementioned? One, some, all of the above?
If so, is this a role owned purely by product management, or do engineers contribute too? Are there contributions from other teams?What tooling do you use to collaborate on documents like this?
Markdown formatted documents, inline comments & pull requests for alterations seems like it'd fit the bill for us, and it's something I'd be interested to experiment with.
Repository for all PRDs with one .md file per document, gists, other? I'm still worried it could alienate the less technical from contributing, and I'm not sure how the semantics should or would work.I know it's one of the less 'sexy' software development topics to talk about, but any insight into how this function works at GitHub would be of great interest to me!Hi Cian!We don't really have a lot of really stringent spec documents, per se. Every team is different ‚Äî¬†we're a large company these days, and have a lot of different ideas of process ‚Äî but generally there's a few different formal ""documents"" we have on a project:If so, is this a role owned purely by product management, or do engineers contribute too? Are there contributions from other teams?It totally depends. Some teams have well-defined project managers, some are led by engineers or designers or people from varied other backgrounds. In most cases, though, engineers are going to help out with these things, because the more information and transparent you can be, the better the idea you'll have about what needs doing.What tooling do you use to collaborate on documents like this?We do virtually all of this on GitHub. Either issues, or pull requests, or sometimes directly in a repository. A huge benefit of working at GitHub is that everyone here uses GitHub. We probably have the best lawyers in the world when it comes to using Git and GitHub, for example. :)Markdown formatted documents, inline comments & pull requests for alterations seems like it'd fit the bill for us, and it's something I'd be interested to experiment with.Yup, Markdown. Markdown's great because at the onset it feels very lightweight: in other words, there's not a lot of inherent structure available, which I think means people can write more informally and persuasively, which in turn makes these documents more accessible (which means people want to read them!)I always think back to college where we had to do these huge binders of product spec documents. Like 100 pages for a relatively simple four-person, four-week project. When these documents are so large and so formal, it's really hard to keep them evolving and growing as you learn more about the project you're working on.Along those lines: something else we'll use frequently is Task Lists. We'll open an issue with 10-20 tasks that need to be done for a project, and since it's pretty accessible, that document explicitly changes and evolves with more tasks as we find things that need doing. I think a really big part of planning a successful project is keeping everyone on the same page, and having one base document that's always up-to-date and that everyone can refer to for the direction of the project is great.I know it's one of the less 'sexy' software development topics to talk aboutHey I love this stuff. :) If you have any other thoughts or questions on this, would be happy to hear more and carry things out in these comments!Very interesting! I feel like it's a developper's dream to have everybody use Git / Github for everythingtl;dr: GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub.Thanks for the detailed reply @holman!The only point I'm puzzling over (and kinda always have), is how you use nothing but issues as a ticketing system. Believe me - I'd love to persuade everybody on my team to abandon our current ticketing system, which is atrociously bad. Most things seem to map just fine - milestones, assignment, tagging over a priority selector (better anyway) - but a few things we use a lot which I can't directly map:Interested in hearing any experience you've had in convincing people away from the more-features-than-you'll-ever-need¬© approach to tooling, towards something more minimal.It's interesting to hear your teams are more scattered than formalised, with not everybody having a project manager, etc - I think it's great that works, and has demonstrably scaled to a big company!
Using markdown for these larger document must be a breeze too. I'm sure we all remember those college projects where they made us write the 40 page spec to match the 800 SLOC project!
Now, if only I could get my immigration attorney drafting things in Markdown rather than .docx, with it's slow-as-tar diff üëçAssociating an issue with a customer. Just tags?Typically we'll just drop the support thread link into the issue. We have a webhook on our repository that looks for those links and then creates a corresponding reference in Halp, our support software. It's a pretty clear connection between the two.Inter-ticket & parent-child relationship within tickets. This quickly becomes a real mess - no need for N-level, 1-level nesting should do it. Just create an empty ticket which tags all it's children in the desc?We use references in issues in order to associate issues and pulls together. With the fixes #xxx syntax, we can create dependencies on each other, too, so that when once closes, the others close. That seems to be worth it enough for us.+1 for referencesTIL: Webhooks happen for more than just git pushes!
Thanks again for the replies"

This is a short guide on what to use in order to have your data backups stored on the  securely. There are many tools around to do the job but the question is can you trust your sensitive data with anyone ? Well for me the answer is always -TNO- trust no one! here is the list of recommended methods and tools.
¬†
¬†¬†¬†For cloud backup I personally use the Amazon RRS S3 then move it to S3 Glacier Amazon account along with CloudBerry with client based encryption because I want more control over a reliable service. Please visit this post to see how I fully backup Linux service to Amazon S3 service.Latest update I have moved from Amazon services to Google Cloud and I am so happy with it. You can manage it with CloudBerry Backup  tool.You can visit this Wikipedia page for full comparison of online backup services.That‚Äôs all you need to know on how to store your backups securely. To know more about encryption please read this document.

Posted  by Warith Al Maawali on Mar 29, 2014 in Blog, Source-Codes | 15 comments
Here is my first experience with api  wrapper. Digital Ocean  and  Vultr provides vps services so if you don‚Äôt want to log into their panel each time you want to perform an action to the vps node you can call the droplets functions from your own website and have your own control panel. First you will need to create your own client ID and  key both can be generated from Digital Ocean user control panel.   Here is the code that I wrote to list all the droplets and perform actions like reboot, shutdown, and power on:¬†¬†¬†
 Download ¬†You will need DO.class.php to be on the same folder as this script:Download DO.class.php class from here.Download do.php code from here.Sample of a working code on Stealthwalker admin control panel:DigitalOcean-do-apiYou can perform more actions as long you have the node id available actions can be found here.
¬†¬†¬†My new experiance is with Vultr Cloud VPS provider you can see their API here. Now let me show you how to wrap it with PHP code its simple with the same concept above except you won‚Äôt have an array.¬†
Download Vultr Api wrapper code from here.
¬†
¬†I am impressed with the ideas you have we can also provide both centralized or take away manual installation script. I like your first approach where have an independent product and let it evolve as the market matures I will put some time into this and study the market stay tuned if I decide to give it a go I will need your valuable experience.Thank you TerenceYou are welcome and I am happy to be a beta tester.  You can always get me at terence dot milbourn at gmail dot com.By the way, Tugboat is the only app I found so far that comes anywhere near it, and its a whole interface away, but I guess you already know that.Terence.Hi Terence,I agree  Tugboat does the job as required but in command line mode no GUI for it yet plus you need Linux to run it. If you notice on the post I have rewritten the code again under method one its more simple now no need for complicated classes.Thank you for sharing üôÇGreat tutorial! I was looking for something like this recently but more specifically for WHMCS. I found a module already written but it costs per month so this will help me create my own module! üôÇSure I will look into them Terence, I appreciate your valuable feedback :).Hi,Have you given any thought to developing this as a product? Perhaps adding support for the Linode API too?  I am not a developer so I can‚Äôt help you there, but I am a long-time software marketer and I‚Äôd love to sell it.Terence.Hi Terence, I haven‚Äôt thought of it but its a good idea. I only wrote it because I am a customer of DO and I wanted to make node management easier. You will be the first to contact whenever I plan to develope one thanks for your valuable input.Hi Warith,I have done quite a bit of research over the last few months and there is quite definitely a hole in the market for a simple control panel to manage multiple VPS nodes.  Not only that, everything out there already ~ and I have personally tested 18 control panels ~ either is bloated with unnecessary open-source utilities, or just doesn‚Äôt work properly, or BOTH! Its a nightmare when the OS installs faultlessly in a couple of minutes, but the control panel grinds on and installing for 15 minutes or so, and then falls over due to missing dependencies.The way to do it is ~ Make it secure.  Keep it simple.  Pray its fast‚Ä¶ üòâTerence.Hi Terence,This sounds interesting from your research it seems that it would definitely get consumers attention if its well implemented.If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what would be your preference as a user ? Is it to have an install script on your own site to control your own nodes for a specific vendor or to have a central solution with no setup hassle where you only login into it enter the API details once of the service you would like to take control. Therefore you can have all the vendors in one secured centralized control panel and the API management product provider takes care of any API changes or updates.Thank you üôÇHi Warith,With the rise of cheap SSD VPS‚Äôs, I think there‚Äôs a growing market for this kind of product. Most of the ‚Äòfree‚Äô and proprietary panels are still focused on shared hosting and not VPS‚Äôs on multiple servers.To make it work though, you need to pull together quite a few different pieces of software from other players; not all in the Open-Source market.  Which, with up-front, one-time and monthly license fees, can make a total solution a tad expensive.For example, ServerPilot will install your a PHP 5.4/5 OpCache Nginx server in-front of Apache and make it all blindingly fast ~ for free ~ then you can install your apps. Or you can use Easy Engine and have an optimised multisite WordPress installation on its own Nginx server in less than a minute ~ again free.But, when you come to selling and managing these servers and having customers pay you, the cPanel, WHMCS and Blesta teams seem to have the market by the shorts.Pulling that kind of fire-power together is always going to be a process, not a product. You may well end up with an all singing and dancing application, but you need to start out simple and the product will take time to evolve as the market matures.From my own perspective, I would prefer to run the script on my own server/s. But I know many others would prefer ~ or are technically challenged and have no choice ~ to let others have the hassle of installation, set-up and maintenance.If I was selling it I would give away the former ~ I am not talking a crippled ‚Äòfreemium‚Äô product here ~ and charge for the latter. Just like WordPress do.  What do you think about that?Terence.warith,Another thought‚Ä¶ why not simply build a plugin for an existing panel like VestaCP, or one of the others, and give yourself immediate access to their market?Terence.warith,If you want some help with this proect, check out this thread. üòâTerence.Hi there, thanks for your comments.  I am having trouble deciding which is best to run a VPS on Digital Ocean: easyengine or Serverpilot? What do you think?Hello Joe,If your are planning to install a PHP 5.4/5 OpCache Nginx server in-front of Apache as Ternce mentioned earlier go for server pilot. You can also check Softaculous and Ammps from  hereHere  is a good article to help you decide.. If I was you I would try the top three then decide which one suites my needs.Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *Comment Name * Email * Website

Posted  by Warith Al Maawali on Aug 1, 2013 in Home Office | 22 comments
SSL Eye is a unique tool that is designed in a way it can detect  man in the middle spying, by comparing   of single or multiple sites across many remote nodes that are owned and managed by EEDS located in different countries such as Singapore, USA, UK, Germany and Netherlands. This is done by comparing the other nodes finger prints results with yours that comes through your local ISP. Additionally the tool will tell you if the site is using Extended Validation () certificates or perfect forward secrecy through the key exchange mechanism such as DHE_RSA or ECDHE_RSA which is currently being used by Google Inc. We have also implemented global short-cut keys on the application that allows you to copy a site from the browser address bar and call it for instant scan to check if you are a victim of Man in The Middle Attack  (). Where normally attackers listen to your communication channel in a public key exchange re-sends the keys on your behalf, substituting his own fake keys for the requested one, so that the two original parties (you and your bank) will still appear to be communicating with each other.

¬†Hi ! I don‚Äôt know what to think : when I scan Youtube, it gives me a different fingerprint from my ISP for many servers. And when I try Google.com (.fr, it makes my isp in blue/green), it makes my ISP also different but in red. What does it mean ? I have no problems for any other websites, and I noticed it‚Äôs always been with Google that there is always something different. Is it normal ?
Thanks !Dear Vael,I can‚Äôt comment about your ISP but here are my results tested through VPN in USA.Youtube.com: a8c9bb25ecd79714b3f7c48a6d4a990ba7398a55Google.com: 4497f7fa2f13aad5dfae738de32c1890249c01e3Google.fr
a8c9bb25ecd79714b3f7c48a6d4a990ba7398a55I could pay for this to be available on my Mac.Thank you Thomas I will consider having a Mac version if I get more requests.Can you please build a software update check into the application? Also would be nice to have a link in the about menu pop-up that leads straight to the product page, instead of the main web site.Sure Seth, I will consider your suggestions on the next release thank you.Hi there,BlackBelt Privacy Team here.Thank you for mentioning our software.
We are constantly trying to improve it and make it more useful for our users.If you have recommendations and we can accommodate them we will.We hope you enjoy using it.Best regards.GDP TeamYou are most welcome and nice follow up from you guys keep it upDear Spousalmilk,For google.com it was a bug that will be fixed on the next release but for google.co.uk its a bit strange I tried it on Linux nodes and I get the same result which is different than Firefox or Chrome..Still working on it will update you..The reason IE on Windows XP was getting the same certificate fingerprint as SSL Eye from http://www.google.co.uk was because neither supported Server Name Indication (SNI).[snippet from wikipedia]
Browsers with support for TLS server name indication
Internet Explorer 7 or later, on Windows Vista or higher. Does not work on Windows XP, even Internet Explorer 8 (because the support of this feature is not browser version dependent, it depends on SChannel system component which introduced the support of TLS SNI extension, starting from Windows Vista, not XP).http://blog.chrismeller.com/testing-sni-certificates-with-openssl
Openssl must be told to send the necessary SNI request (add the switch -servername http://www.google.co.uk)openssl s_client -servername http://www.google.co.uk -connect http://www.google.co.uk:443 /dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdin
>9B:4C:03:99:61:82:4F:EC:EA:00:61:7B:87:9B:6B:C7:CE:10:BF:09
^this fingerprint now matches what I‚Äôm getting in the Firefox and ChromeThank you for the information it is clear now we have to find a solution with indy component to support SNI. Hopefully version 2 of SSLEYE will have it solved stay tuned üôÇYou missed < character before /dev/null working code would be:



openssl s_client -servername www.google.co.uk -connect www.google.co.uk:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdinYou‚Äôre welcome. üôÇ It‚Äôs because I forgot to put the command in code tags that it came out like it did. I miss the preview post button like on forums. Looking forward to the next release!Dear Spousalmilk, SSLEYE 1.5 has been released and the bug has been fixed with some extra features added. Thank you for your valuable input again please try the new verion and spread the word in wilderssecurity thread you mentioned earlier.Hi there, we need some assistance regarding SSL Eye and ‚ÄúYour Local ISP‚Äù scan results. Hope you can help us out here: http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/google-compromised-mitm.364063/#post-2373487Dear Spousalmilk,Thank you for reporting this issue we are looking into it and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Hi mate!
Looks like an excellent tool‚Ä¶.thanks you very much to give me/us the opportunity to use it for FREE!Just a question for you: do you know if freeware like ‚Äúblackbelt privacy‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúCryptSync‚Äù can also be used as a means to avoid or at least minimize the risk of the Man-in-the-middle attack?http://sourceforge.net/projects/blackbeltpriv
http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/CryptSync.htmlAnd finally‚Ä¶ever tried this??http://securityxploded.com/sslcertscanner.phpDear Joe,Thank you as well for trying SSLEye. CryptSync is good tool with following downsides:1 ‚Äì Duplication of files (Unless you use your cloud for backup only).Then I would go for Crashplan.
2- Uses 7-zip to encypt which is limited to AES-256.To overcome this limitation and have stronger encryption I would use Truecrypt container and sync it to the cloud using CryptSync. If you are using Dropbox and you need to access files in more than one device then replace True-crypt with PGP.
Please have a look at the following articles for more tools and methods:http://www.digi77.com/ways-to-deliver-your-messages-securely-and-anonymous/
and
http://www.digi77.com/backup-where-to-store-and-what-to-use-for-your-backup/BlackBelt the only advantage I see is them using your current installed Fire-fox winch overcomes the limitation of using Tor-bundle that unfortunately is always packed with out of date Firefox package. However if you would like to have a tool that has more features such as  vpn + Tor + Dns encryption then use Stealthwalker.http://www.digi77.com/stealth-walker-vpn/In short BlackBelt and CryptSync minimize the risk of unwanted eyes on your content and connection however there are better alternatives that do the same in better quality.For SSLCertScanner I don‚Äôt think its worth it as I can always push to you a valid fake certificate and the tool will report it as valid. You can use a better validation tool from SSL labs
https://www.ssllabs.com/ Both SSL labs and BlackBeltof can be used to validate SSL certificate but non of them would detect SSL Man in The Middle attack or spy as SSLEye does by validating the finger print of any certificate not only from your PC but from other remote nodes as well.Thank you very much for your exaustive reply.
Honestly I was not aware of StealthWalker, which seems to me simply amazing: how the heck is a tool like this FREE of charge?By the way, what do you make of this Free ‚ÄãCross-platform Multi-protocol VPN program?http://www.softether.org/Ever heard it before?Your are most welcome, Its free for the sake of marketing.However we still have a premium package for users who wish to have dedicated and faster servers.Regarding Sofethere the idea is brilliant to support all protocols which are widely used plus their own Ethernet over SSL protocol which is transparent on firewalls. Once they release the source code of their server we will consider switching to Sofehere. With no doubts they the Japanese developed a powerful tool.For better understanding how it works I encourage you to read the following article:http://www.softether.org/1-features/1._Ultimate_Powerful_VPN_ConnectivityBy the way here are list of tools that can replace Dropbox and CryptSync with encryption done locally before submission to the cloud‚Ä¶wuala 5GB

Posted  by Warith Al Maawali on Aug 21, 2013 in Blog | 2 comments
SSL is the technology used to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between the browser and server. By encrypting the data, you protect messages from being read while they are transferred across the Internet.  encrypts a message from the web browser, or application then sends it to the server. When the message is received by the server,  decrypts it and verifies that it came from the correct sender (a process known as authentication). It took me a while to understand how to strengthen SSL and TLS connections between server and the clients. Most of us when performing SSL test on  SSL Labs we get grade B or C some times even F. You can test your own site or the site you trust like e-banking by visiting  SSL Labs or if you would like to have an exclusive test of Heatbleed attack please click  here. On this blog I will explain step by step on how to get a grade A+, mitigate the , , , and  attack with strong choice of ciphers. All you have to do is update your Openssl and replace the default settings on your Web server config file and here are the steps on CentOS:¬†¬†¬†¬†First you have to update your OpenSSL manual installation (centOS 5 or 6):
I am using openssl-1.0.2j get the latest version number from here.Verify that you are running the latest version of Openssl:If you still see the old version please run the following command:Check supported ciphers:You will need to recompile Apache now:Then locate your Web server config file:Edit the file with nano:Search for ‚ÄòSSLCipherSuite‚Äô using CTRL W and replace it with:My preference is to paste all of the above into post_virtualhost_global.conf instead of httpd.conf:So the file would look like this:Your score should have grade A now:ssl-labs report¬†Up to this level you should get grade A by ssllabs but if you need an A+ then you need to force https for every virtual host you have add this line just after virtual host ip:portOr do it my way:Paste the following:If you would like to exclude all other domains just use the following code:Then let the Webserver force https on all http requests:Finally restart your Web server (Apache):Your score should have grade A+ now:

In order to mitigat POODLE attack we removed SSL3 support as the following:In order to get 100 scores on protocol support you should only support TLSv1.2 which is impractical as many clients wont support it:
You can find more Linux commands here please contact us if you need us to have grade A+ on your websiteIf you face error while using curl command such as:Use the following command to fix it:Adding CAcert root certificate to (Debian/Ubuntu):Verbose listing of all OpenSSL except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by strength:Output will look like this:For Windows Server Admins, here‚Äôs the optimal ordered and curated cipher suite by Steve Gibson:The following are auto update commands on CentOS but you won‚Äôt get the latest version:Or install it if not installed :For a proper AXIVO repository setup click here.¬†¬†Please use the following URL for a proper AXIVO repository setup:

You may be aware of how team viewer works it can almost work behind any sort of  or . The secret behind it is that both client and server do not contact each other directly but via a repeater that is owned by the company and allows the client and server to initiate a reverse connection to the repeater. If you are worried not to have a third party between your  sessions I will explain  on this blog how to setup your own repeater on Linux as for windows its straight forward.

100,10063537,What Trump Teaches Us About Online Trolls,http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/08/donald-trump-the-ultimate-political-troll.html,2015,"FOLLOW:ShareLike most casual observers of the early stages of the 2016 presidential race, I was confused at first by Donald Trump‚Äôs strong showing in the polls. Then I heard Jon Stewart compare him to an internet troll, and it all started to make sense.¬†After all, Trump spouts tired racist and sexist tropes, yet fancies himself a bold real-talker who dares to say what others won‚Äôt. He doesn‚Äôt have a big vocabulary or employ nuanced arguments, yet is endlessly self-aggrandizing. His remarks cause ‚Äúpolitical firestorms,‚Äù but rather than engage with the responses they engender, he quickly adopts the posture of a victim. If you point out that he might be wrong, or unnecessarily mean, he claims that you‚Äôre attacking and trying to silence him. He only gets stronger if you decide to take him on directly, yet not calling him out means he‚Äôs free to keep spraying his hatred all over everyone.¬†On this last point, Trump is particularly vexing. He presents us with the same dilemma that an online troll does: Do you ignore him, and allow him to proceed unchecked as if his behavior is acceptable? Or do you challenge him, knowing full well that contentious exchanges are what feed him?The uncertainty over just how seriously to take Trump mirrors our collective lack of clarity about how to shut down bullying and hateful internet speech. We often applaud when someone takes on a troll directly, while remaining reluctant to jump in ourselves. Megyn Kelly lifted many hearts when she directly addressed Trump‚Äôs history of unrepentant sexism and misogynist one-liners during the Republican presidential debate, but she was met with silence from those in the room with her. ‚ÄúThough Kelly called Trump out on his history of misogynistic insults, none of his nine opponents onstage took exception to his crude attack on Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell or to the laughter and cheers it aroused from the audience,‚Äù Frank Rich points out. Social media lit up with support, but in the room, at that moment, she was alone. (On the Dem side, Bernie Sanders applauded Kelly on Twitter, though it took a reporter pressing Hillary Clinton on the question for her to call Trump‚Äôs remarks offensive.)When asked about the Kelly question later, Trump took the opportunity to double down on misogyny, implying that Kelly was just on her period. Even then, Fox News did not marshal its considerable PR resources in Kelly‚Äôs defense, choosing instead to step lightly. Like the comments-section cranks, Trump translates to traffic ‚Äî as he‚Äôll be the first to remind you ‚Äî and therefore media companies don‚Äôt stand to gain much by alienating him. Left unchecked, trolls encourage more trolls ‚Äî which is exactly what happened to Kelly. She got a tsunami once Trump identified her as a target. Some of his GOP opponents took the opportunity to call him out. ‚ÄúIf no one stands up to a bully, a bully will keep doing what he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Rand Paul said. And Carly Fiorina spoke in solidarity with Kelly: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had lots of men imply that I was unfit for decision-making because maybe I was having my period.‚Äù Yet it seems that Trump has only grown stronger. ‚ÄúHe lives for this kind of trash talk,‚Äù observed a reporter.Perhaps this is why people who find Trump odious are more likely to just ignore him and hope he‚Äôll go away. Trolls feed on attention, after all. This is generally how I feel about the anonymous haters who pepper my Twitter replies with slurs and taunts. I simply don‚Äôt have time for them, so I mute them swiftly. If we all spent our time addressing the Trumps of the internet ‚Äî and the world ‚Äî we‚Äôd have no energy left for what actually matters to us. Worse, we‚Äôd be letting them dictate the agenda. However, ignoring Trump, as many observers have pointed out, won‚Äôt make him go away.‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with him?!‚Äù Stewart asked about Trump, vocalizing a question that I‚Äôve long had about the men who send me hate-filled emails. But as many women who have engaged with their internet tormentors have discovered, there‚Äôs not always something wrong with trolls. When writer Lindy West confronted a man who had cruelly harassed her online ‚Äî he went so far as to create a Twitter parody account mocking her dead father ‚Äî the man wrote her to apologize. Later, he explained to her that trolling was his private hobby, not something he told his girlfriend about: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing. I work with women all day, and I don‚Äôt have an issue with anyone.‚Äù He seemed to be implying that most trolls are regular guys who, in their offline lives, are kept in check by social mores. Online, unchecked, they can let their darker impulses run wild. At least Trump is doing all of this under his own name.What Trump really has in common with anonymous trolls is an uncanny ability to channel the very worst human impulses and articulate them plainly and publicly. Ignoring such hate speech is a great strategy for preserving your sanity in the short term, but it won‚Äôt go away as long as it‚Äôs validated by other people, be they message-board allies or major media outlets. Hateful comments are a ‚Äúsystem failure.‚Äù I don‚Äôt relish the things that online commenters are able to say under a cloak of anonymity, but I prefer a scenario in which they‚Äôre ashamed to own up to their comments than a world in which they can run a presidential campaign on them.Which is why I admire women like Megyn Kelly and Lindy West. Their confrontations make clear that they do not want to live in a world where trollish behavior is widely accepted. And they issue a challenge to the rest of us to speak up, too. Trump and trolls may seem inexhaustible, but together we are certainly more powerful. Kelly announced yesterday that she is taking a much-needed vacation. Maybe she‚Äôs just resting up so she‚Äôll be fresh and on her game when the campaign ramps up this fall. Kelly, at least, seems to understand that there is no ‚Äúblock‚Äù button for presidential candidates. And the sooner the rest of us get that, the better.goopEat This for Healthy Hair: 7 Days of GOOP CLEAN BEAUTY

101,10207727,Microsoft interested to acquire AMD,http://www.fudzilla.com/news/graphics/38725-microsoft-interested-to-acquire-amd,2015,"Exclusive: Talks taking placeOur industry sources claim that Microsoft is seriously talking to AMD about buying the chipmaker. The pair have been in talks for a while, but we are unsure if the deal is happening or when something will be announced.¬†It is no secret that AMD's CPU roadmap is hardly competitive. From late 2015 and through most of 2016 the business has been rubbish. The hope of Zen cores being successful is AMD's only option for survival. Microsoft ¬†has a lot of cash in the bank and has a place for AMD under its wing.In case that Microsoft does acquire AMD, as we suggested a few months back, it will control the development of the next generation console chip for its future Xbox and it would be able to create decent GPUs to promote its DirectX 12 and beyond. Of course Microsoft would have to compete with Nvidia. Linux fans of AMD GPUs would not be too happy about it, although Redmond has been getting more open source friendly lately.When it comes to CPUs, the future Zen derivative could end up in the future Surface, you know the tablet that iPad Pro copied the form factor, the cover keyboard and the pen. AMD has a server division as well as computational division, everything that Microsoft uses.The fact that Raja Koduri, a man behind cool things at ART X and ATI Radeon R300 now runs Radeon Technology Group could mean that the company might be acquired in pieces too. We always suggested that one of the solutions is that AMD sells off GPU business to a company that would licence it back to AMD for its APU products.Our well informed industry sources suggest that Intel is interested in the acquisition of AMD. Before you blast us with your comments, the world changed a few years back and Intel is not a monopoly anymore. Apple has quite big of a stake with iPads and companies like Samsung have their own SoCs that are used for their tablets and phones. Qualcomm and MediaTek got stronger as well. In this changed world Intel would have a chance to acquire AMD if it really wanted. ¬†Desktop, Server, Notebooks will survive but some of these market segments are simply becoming less relevant than five years ago. Yes, the world has changed.¬†

          Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.
        This was submitted to the Tech Challenge posted by Vista Print (http://lifeinvistaprint.com/technology/tech-challenge-2014/) and it won first prize!You should also checkout this entry posted by Daniel Hartmeier 
http://www.benzedrine.cx/3D-ODRPP.htmlHe also was so kind as to post reference input/output-sets that you could use to test this thing on. And I believe his solution even packs the boxes tighter (at least in some cases) .. lucky for me that wasn't the only criteria :-)This is all released under the 3-clause BSD-license. See below.Use maven (http://maven.apache.org/) to build like:This should produce a single jar-file named pickpack.jarProject requires Java 8.The jar-file is directly runnable likeReading inputset.txt from std-in (in spec. format) and returning
result on std-out as spec.NOTE: currently the reader will break the reading loop if it sees a blank line.Its obvious that this challenge is akin to classical packing problems in CS.
This class of problems is know to be NP-hard - as no P-time algorithm is know
either for packing or verifying that the result is in fact optimal.The packaging-algorithm in this project is my own invention - even though its probably described somewhere else prior.
It is based on two main-ideas/observations:A package can be described as a box of boxes. So a specific packaging of a box could be described as a
tree-structure where the actual boxes are leaves and the nodes of the tree are ""virtual"" boxes-of-boxes.If you normalize two boxes - in the sense that you turn them in such a way that the dimensions are 
sorted - and then combine them joining on the largest surface they can be contained in a bounded rectangular shape.
Adding those boxes back to the set, recombining them until only one box remains will lead to a cube-sized box.So the algorithm is in the divide-and-conquer category. Combine two boxes. Fill the spaces left in the rectangular box
(using as many boxes as will fit) - then uses the resulting box as another box in further recombining.Because of its simplicity the algorithm can be applied a number of times on the same set - using a randomized
 re-packaging stage - to look for the best solution.Testing the current implementation it does a 100 rounds on my machine in no more than a few 100 ms (single threaded).
It can easily be executed in parallel - just comparing results after a number of threads have completed packaging on
the same input. On standard hardware this would allow millions of operations to be completed per hour.This project was done in the little spare time I have between job and family. A lot of clean-up should be done. And
the tests in the project are merely there to stage debugging.Copyright (c) 2014, Lars Szuwalski

By Jeremy Kirk

Australia Correspondent,
IDG News Service |
December 10, 2013

Disqus is updating its widely-used comments platform after a Swedish tabloid exposed politicians and other public figures for allegedly making highly offensive comments on right-wing websites.The Swedish daily Expressen, working with an investigative journalism group, said it uncovered the identity of hundreds of people who left offensive comments at four right-wing websites through their email addresses. It then confronted the authors of the comments, many of whom freely admitted to writing them.Later on Tuesday, Disqus said its network had not been breached and that it did not leak email addresses. The journalists appeared to have abused a feature it used for a third-party service, it said.Based on information from Disqus and other observers, a general picture of the journalists' method has emerged.Disqus used a third-party service called Gravatar from Automattic, the company behind the WordPress software. Users can upload an avatar, which will then appear on any Gravatar-enabled website.A Disqus API (application programming interface) fetched avatars from Gravatar using the hashed email addresses of registered users. A hash is a cryptographic representation of a value processed by an algorithm.For example, the email address ""idg@idgnews.com"" when processed by the MD5 algorithm appears as this hash: ""0ff3eeab2b765f017a526bbddd328c3b.""The journalists likely collected the nicknames of commentators from the websites, then pinged Disqus' API to see what MD5 value was returned. They could have gained access to Disqus' API by creating an account, according to Eaxbreakparty, a blog run by a self-described cryptography enthusiast.With that value in hand, a couple of scenarios are possible. If the journalists already had a database of personal email addresses, they could generate the MD5 hash for those addresses and then see which ones match the hashes returned by Disqus.Also, it is possible, but difficult, to convert MD5 hashes back to their original value, which would give them email addresses with which to perform further research.Disqus said in a statement that ""to use our API or service for such purposes, is a breach of our privacy guidelines."" The account believed to have been used for the research would be terminated, it said.The company said it would also disable Gravatar and remove ""the MD5 hash email addresses from the API.

It is not a secret that many parents do not take part in their children education per se. I was looking at the decay of secondary education in Ukraine for many years - my boys are going to graduate soon; and, like many other desperate moms and dads, I started thinking how to foster my children‚Äôs interest to learn their native language and so on.AdvertisementFor those, who have a clue about modern Web and technologies it is clear that any website requires content, as its a must constituent. Moreover, almost always a niche ones going to fill on WWW is occupied and there is nothing to do with it. Taking in account the situation, I picked a ‚Äòvintage‚Äô grammar of Ukrainian, which is a great school-book by the way, and offered my apprentices to turn it into electronic manual. While typing the text of the manual they had, more or less attentively, to read it down to the last page, which was a super-task in itself. While they have been told that this website may become their future resume first entry, in case they decide to become web-developers or something like that.This is not our story end and we keep moving further: now we are working on exercises that will be a base material to our Ukrainian grammar trainer-application..."

Yamaha Motor Co.'s design team, which ordinarily handles motorcycles and bicycles, leveraged their expertise with bent tubing to create ""Raijin"" (""God of the Thunder""), which looks like a zero-gravity drum kit:The musical instrument design team came up with ""Root"", a motorcycle whose concept I frankly find impenetrable:Judging by the editing in this video, the vehicle is almost certainly not rideable:Again utilizing bent tubing, the Motor Co. design group developed ""Fujin"" (""God of the Wind""), a marimba that incorporates a motorcycle's two-seat configuration:While you can't tell from the still photos, the team cleverly added rotary motion to the equation:The musical instrument design team's other effort was ""Zero Plus/Minus Zero,"" a prototype for an electrically power-assisted bicycle and charging stand:The A HA MAY project was undertaken primarily to create a Yamaha exhibition at France's recent Biennale Interationale Design Saint-Etienne, and was not intended to serve as a true competition. Nevertheless, I have to say I'm more impressed at the transportation designers' ability to adapt than the other way 'round. The Motor Co. designers seem to have a better grasp of materials and stronger concept generation. (Admittedly it may not be fair to compare the two, as each field has distinctly different requirements.)In any case, here are members of both teams discussing what they were going for, along with some cool process footage:Join over 300,000 designers who stay up-to-date with the Core77 newsletter...Test it out; it only takes a single click to unsubscribeRain Noe is a writer and industrial designer based in New York City.Fantastic!

It looks lazy and is very disappointing.Meanwhile the instrument team designed the beautiful Root motorcycle, with elegant curves and great material usage.

115,7075150,Comparing machine learning classifiers,http://tjo-en.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/01/06/234155,2014,"Quote saved.Login to quote this blogFailed to save quote. Please try again later.You cannot quote because this article is private.In Japanese version of this blog, I've written a series of posts about how each kind of machine learning classifiers draws various classification hyperplanes or decision boundaries.So in this post I want to show you a summary of the series and how their hyperplanes or decision boundaries vary (translated from Japanese version). It must be interesting and help you understand a nature of each classifier. Here I chose some representative classifiers as follows: decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR: only for linearly separable cases), support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN: back-propagation multi-layer perceptron) and random forest (RF). They are all supervised learning methods and easy to import in R*1.I'm still new to this field and just a ""package-user"", not serious expert in machine learning and its scientific basis*2. For such people, explaining meanings of algorithms or theorems is not helpful for understanding how they work -- instead, visualized feature (= hyperplanes or decision boundaries) well help us, I believe.In order to overview how different their hyperplanes or decision boundaries  are, I also arranged various 2D data sets: linearly separable (binary or 3-classes), linearly inseparable binary XOR (simple or complex) and linearly inseparable 4-classes XOR patterns. You can see easily it through these visualization of the hyperplanes or decision boundaries.In each example below, I supposed that the true distribution were just a combination of 2, 3 or 4 two-dimensional normal distributions*3. Below are codes that generated the XOR patterns as an example.


Two linearly separable patterns were merely a part of the XOR patterns above, except in the 3-classes case only I added one more two-dimensional normal distribution along y=x function.We can evaluate how much each classifier got generalized and how precisely each one classified with looking at each decision boundary because already we know how the true distribution was*4; If each one follows well ture boundaries between quadrants*5, the one gets well generalized. At the same time you can easily see how many points get mis-classified. This is the purpose that I wrote this post. To simplify what we have to do, I omitted any cross-validation or classification tests for novel data; just looking at hyperplanes or decision boundaries is important for understanding how they work.



First, I'll show you a series of hyperplanes or decision boundaries by binary classification methods. This is the simplest and easiest classification problem -- but I feel their behaviors are much interesting.As expected, LR and NN worked well; in particular NN gave almost the same hyperplane as simple perceptron does. In linearly separable cases, NN can change itself to a variant of simple perceptron so that the hyperplane of NN looks very natural. There is no need to comment on LR: that is merely the best case for LR.Interestingly, hyperplanes of DT, SVM (Gaussian kernel)((In this post I omitted SVM with linear kernel because the result is obvious :P))) and RF appear much worse. In particular for DT and RF, I think why they gave worse hyperplanes is that in principle their hyperplanes or decision boundaries must be drawn in parallel with x or y axis... they're far away from the correct decision boundary such that LR or NN gave. I'm afraid hyperplanes of DT, SVM and RF may be less generalized in this case.



Almost all of classification functions in R can also handle multi-class problems*6. As a simple expansion, I ran 3-classes classifications with DT, LR, NN, SVM (Gaussian kernel), NN and RF.The result is more interesting. Hyperplanes or decision boundaries by DT, SVM and RF got further worse and more curious, even though still LR and NN gave clear 2 linear hyperplanes as expected. In multi-class cases, we may have to consider DT, SVM or RF can be almost never generalized... I feel, more classes, more problems of such classifiers in generalization ""boosted"".



I think XOR pattern should be the best for testing classifiers whether they can work in any linearly inseparable case. In particular, an advantage of NN over simple perceptron is that NN can correctly classify an XOR pattern although simple perceptron cannot.  Here I omitted LR because LR doesn't work in linearly inseparable cases*7.The results were as I expected. DT, SVM and RF worked well. Only NN shows a little skewed hyperplanes... that slightly differ from the true boundaries. I have some concerns.



In addition to the XOR pattern above, this pattern includes some overlaps between quadrants. Such overlaps make it harder to classify than the simple pattern, of course.Some results look like joking. In particular those of SVM #2 and #3 were crazy, too overfitted, almost no generalized. On the other hand, SVM #1 was too generalized: yeah, it well followed the true boundaries, but its accuracy was bad (approx. 80%).NN was not bad, but also a little overfitted. Accuracy of RF was great (100%) but looks a little overfitted too. I know it's hard to balance generalization and accuracy, but just in my opinion SVM #1 or #3 can be ""not bad"".



As already seen in the 3-classes case, most of classifiers in R packages provide multi-class classification methods. Of course, they can also solve more than 3-classes multi-classes problems.Just for fun, I ran 4-classes classifications with DT, 3 versions of SVM, NN and RF. In order to evaluate their performance, I also wrote down classification accuracy of each classifier.


The results well described how each classifier worked. As the 3-classes problem boosted wrong points of the classifiers in generalization, this 4-classes problem also seemed to boost them.In terms of generalization, SVM #1, NN were better; they followed the true boundaries well, but their accuracy were bad. On the other hand, DT, SVM #2 & #3 were quite worse, too overfitted. Their hyperplanes or decision boundaries never reflected the true ones.It was interesting that accuracy of RF was perfect (100%) but at the same time the global feature of the decision boundaries of RF seems to follow the true boundaries very well. Only RF showed a good balance between generalization and accuracy in this case.



As well known in general, these results reminded me of importance of how to choose appropriate classifiers for each pattern. We have to apply LR or NN for linearly separable patterns, and SVM or RF for linearly inseparable patterns. In particular, choosing LR for linearly separable cases is very important; choosing worse classifiers for the case such as DT or RF can be harmful.But in many cases, we don't know whether the dataset is linearly separable or inseparable. If so, choosing RF is better, I think. RF has a good balance of generalization and accuracy, and its computational cost is relatively low, even it can be distributed.Personally, I want to learn more about NN; a data scientist colleague, who used to be a professional researcher on algorithms of NN, told me that NN is super flexible with tuning a lot of parameters. Once we enough understand how to tune them well, he says NN must be the most useful classifier and that's why NN is back as ""Deep Learning"".

116,6555022,5 Reasons Tech Companies Make Bad Gadgets (An Inside Look),http://www.cracked.com/article_20689_5-reasons-tech-companies-make-bad-gadgets-an-inside-look.html,2013,"At some point in your life, probably in the last year, you've paid good money for a cool piece of technology that turned out to be a piece of shit. It had features that made no sense at all, and at some point you asked yourself, ""How could a building full of geniuses with millions in R&D money come up with this?""Well, I'll tell you how. My name is Christopher Daed, and I've put in time in the tech industry with Microsoft, Intel, and others. And from what I've seen ...Bin im GartenIn 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to great fanfare. And by fanfare, I mean almost universal loathing. Why would they build an OS that seemed custom designed for tablets, even though the vast majority of people are still using PCs?Comstock/Stockbyte/Getty Images""... the hell? I can't tear pages out of this when the TP's gone.""I know why: Because Microsoft's product managers LOVE tablets, just like they LOVED the laptops with swiveling touchscreens that also failed to win America's heart. It isn't that they were stupid -- tablets were really useful in their jobs. They just forgot that the rest of the world didn't live the daily life of a product manager in Redmond, Washington. It's like designing magnetic license plate covers completely unaware that some cars might be made of plastic.This is a deeper problem than just a few product managers at Microsoft, by the way. Ever wondered why those nerds in Silicon Valley can make constant high-speed Internet access a requirement for every device under the sun and not realize how goddamn inconvenient that is for millions of people with spotty connections? It's because every gadget you've ever bought was conceived of, designed, and tested in what amounts to a utopia of speedy Internet by a bunch of software geeks who, if you took away their Internet, would collapse into a seizure.Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty ImagesMinutes without Wi-Fi: 2.But even when it's a subject developers do have personal experience with -- namely, Internet porn -- there's a disconnect with the users. How many of you are paranoid about storing naked photos on your computer because there don't seem to be any easy ""I don't want anyone but me to see this"" options for storage? Well, get this -- in the early stages of Windows Vista, I saw that there was a feature that would scan your hard drive for all image files, then shuffle them randomly as the logo for the picture folder.All the images on your drive. Yes, even those images.Comstock/Stockbyte/Getty Images""Those mountain goats are all adults, I swear.""The problem is that, in a business setting, surrounded by their peers and managers, no one wanted to stand up and declare themselves the self-appointed representative of perverts. Instead, I had to be the one to say, ""What if I want my family photos separate from my desktop backgrounds?"" with ""family photos"" standing in for ""porn"" (as they always do).On another occasion, I worked on a car stereo that would connect to your phone and allow you to make and receive phone calls. What made this one interesting was that it synced your full contact list and call history to display on the screen. And if you had more than one phone in the family, it would simply merge the two, with a little icon showing which phone that call belonged to. Now imagine being the guy who has to bring up that not every man wants his wife to see his complete call history whenever she gets into the car (and vice versa).Jupiterimages/Creatas/Getty ImagesThe beta also saved audio from all the obscene songs you sing to yourself in traffic.And it's even harder bringing these issues up because everyone in these meetings has to pretend to be utterly dumfounded by the idea that humans may do things in private that they don't want shared with the world. At times it was hard to tell if they were being willfully oblivious and condescending or simply fucking with me.Lional Bonaventure / AFP / GettyIf you browse headlines at tech sites, these days you'll hear a lot about patents, specifically ""patent trolls."" It's hard to understand sometimes how this impacts you, the customer, so let me give you an example:In 1999, Amazon attained the patent for single-click purchase. Yep, just that general concept, which really every retailer should have. It would be like if Nike decided to patent the way we all tie our shoelaces so that suddenly everyone has to either send Nike a check every morning or learn another way to tie their shoes.Medioimages/Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images""Does it break the patent if I'm drunk when I do it?""Then you have someone like me developing the purchase engine for an online game years later -- the sort of thing that lets your character buy health potions and a sword that turns orcs into chickens or something using real-world money. So the character goes into the store and looks at the product list on the blackboard behind the proprietor. He selects the things he wants, maybe sells his extra wolf's bane and cat's eyeballs, and sees if he can afford the sheep gun, whatever. Total immersion. Then, when he's done, the whole thing freezes. He's taken out of the game and shown a meaningless popup with one button. That is there because having the whole transaction only take one click wouldn't be fair to Amazon.Meanwhile, if you've ever made a one-click purchase through another online store, it's because they paid Amazon a shitload of money to do so. Unless you live in Europe, where they've decided that one-click shopping is way too obvious of an idea to patent. This is all because it's not at all clear what exactly we should and shouldn't be able to patent when it comes to technology.Brand X Pictures/Stockbyte/Getty Images""Your patent for the use of gavels in legal judgments has been approved. Here's $40.""But patent trolling is even worse. At least Amazon intended to use their invention and just wanted to be the only one -- patent trolls exist only to stop other people from using the ideas. These are tiny companies made of nothing but lawyers and a thin film of moss who will buy up or file for patents to cover every conceivable product. Then they sue the pants off of any company that dares to use anything resembling the intellectual property they had zero hand in creating in the first place. According to one estimate, fighting these firms has cost U.S. companies more than $500 billion over the last 20 years.It's a nightmare -- if you intend to invent something new or start your own business, you do it knowing that there is this swarm of patent trolls prowling around out there, looking to see if your product steps on any of the many, many patents they're hoarding just for that purpose. It's a big enough problem that President Obama had to get involved. Not that it will stop the Motorolas and Microsofts of the world from trolling each other.Mario Tama / Getty""We've decided to sue everyone who uses a glass screen. It might as well be a window.""Digital Vision./Photodisc/Getty ImagesIn May of 2013, the Xbox One was revealed. It was revealed again about a month later. And again a month after that. In what was one of the worst marketing stories in modern times, Microsoft has had to apologize for, retract, and significantly alter many of the things that define their new console. But as much bad blood as this created with gamers, there is just as much within the company.Both these hooligans were immediately speared to death by Xbox fundamentalists.What people need to understand is that the engineers developing the Xbox are also huge gamers. Their offices are cluttered with action figures, arcade machines, extra TVs hooked up to old consoles, gaming posters, huge cardboard standups of space heroes, etc. They have their favorite game moments as desktop backgrounds. They have tournaments during lunch. They love this stuff. And they worked so hard on this awesome new game device. And then during the initial reveal it was sold by marketing as a fucking TiVo with a camera:If it sounds like there is a huge gulf between marketing (the people who supposedly know what the customers want) and engineering (the people who have to build the thing), you don't know the half of it. Look back on the last bad phone/game console/whatever you bought, the one that made you say, ""What were they thinking?"" The odds are very good that it was a result of the fact that these two departments just hate talking to each other.BananaStock/BananaStock/Getty ImagesThis picture is a dramatization. Less than 4 percent of marketers possess the vampiric gene.The problem is so huge that this gulf between engineering and marketing is one of the most widely studied phenomena in the tech industry. A survey of around 300 tech products in development showed that about 2 out of 3 experienced ""disharmony"" between the marketing and engineering departments. And nearly 70 percent of the time, that disharmony led to a failed product. Engineers see marketers as snake oil salesmen who would skin their mother if they thought they could sell it as an aphrodisiac. Marketers see engineers as a bunch of nerdy code monkeys who couldn't sell a tropical island to a drowning man. The sad thing is, to a degree, they're both right.Let's say, as a hypothetical, we were tasked with improving the country's rail system. If left to their own devices, engineering would come up with some form of hovering magnetic rail system that would get you to your destination with blinding speed and absolute safety ... and only cost double the GNP of Ireland. Marketing would suggest repainting the existing trains and simply advertising that cars kill people.Medioimages/Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images""It doesn't have seats, but compared to a motorcycle it's safe!""The bosses know they hate each other, so there's typically at least one layer of management between the two groups to prevent all-out civil war. But this means that it's even harder for the two sides to talk to each other, and it takes both to create a successful product. And while we're on the subject of people not talking to each other ...Duncan Smith/Photodisc/Getty ImagesIn 2007, mainstream PCs went from single core to dual core -- basically two processors in one. It's like having a second head making decisions for you, except with slightly less bickering. Then they went to quad-core processors, the implication being that you were getting four times as much horsepower. So let me ask you: Is your quad-core PC four times as fast?Creatas Images/Creatas/Getty ImagesHow many times in the last year have you said, ""My computer sure is running unexpectedly fast!""Hell, no. That's because the software you're using doesn't give a shit about your multiple cores, or how fast your PC/phone runs in general. The Facebook app has zero knowledge of the email app, and both have no knowledge (and don't give a shit) about your pending high score in Candy Crush. Facebook just knows that it wants to do an update and claims whatever resources it thinks it needs to do that. Email does the same thing. And that's why the home screen on your four-core, 2.3GHz smartphone freezes whenever your playlist switches songs. Without software designed to take advantage of them, your multiple cores are just so many bull nipples.The same thing happens with your PC. You have a ton of power, but for a lot of you reading this, if you open Word and Warcraft at the same time, you might as well go make a sandwich. That's because every application you run is designed with the bizarre assumption that it's the only thing you'll have running.AdobeSeetharaman Narayanan is a bit of a narcissist.So adding cores became a great selling point, and chip makers were happy to keep cramming more of them in there. But you don't see the benefits, because the people writing the software have no motivation to take advantage.Creatas/Creatas/Getty ImagesIt's easy to think that the main problem with a big company like Microsoft (or Nokia, or Hewlett-Packard, or ...) is that they don't have any new ideas. But that's not true -- at any given moment, they've got tons of awesome things in development. So many, in fact, that the bad ideas crowd out the good ones. There is only so much staff and money to go around.Robyn Beck / AFP / GettyHewlett-Packard labs, where groundbreaking technology meets shit nobody wants.For instance, remember back when Microsoft had the most popular smartphone on the market? No? It was as recently as 2007. Ever wonder what happened with that?Well, in 2008, Microsoft figured they could remain king of the hill by purchasing Danger (makers of the Sidekick), with the aim of building an awesome new smartphone to compete with the newly launched iPhone and Google's unreleased Android operating system. These were the pioneer days of smartphones, and being pioneer days, most of us never quite made it to the cellphone equivalent of Oregon. Instead, we ended up with Razrs. Which are, what, cholera in this analogy?Dante Alighieri
Yeah, sounds about right.But not to worry -- the team from Danger was going to build Microsoft a smartphone so good, it'd make Steve Jobs turn his blue jeans brown. Microsoft called their uberphone the Kin.The Kin came. It sold a total of 8,000 units, not even one for every 10 Microsoft employees. The company lost $62,500 per phone sold.You gotta spend money to make money! And also to lose millions, apparently.So what went wrong? Well, for starters, Microsoft took all the brilliant and innovative minds they'd bought from Danger and said, ""Knock all that creative shit off."" Half the Danger team wound up working on the Kin, and the other half got shuffled into developing Windows Phone 7. You see, giant corporations are the same as the character in every laugh track sitcom who winds up dating two women at once: They'd rather fuck up two things than focus on one and do it right. Microsoft had people who knew where the future of smartphones lay. But they also had Steve ""If It's Worked Once, It'll Work Forever"" Ballmer, a man who throws chairs when he gets angry.It was the same with tablets. Way back before the iPad launched, photos of a Microsoft project called Courier leaked out to the tech press. It appeared to be a sort of dual-screen digital notebook, and every blogger in the gadget world ejaculated in unison. But if you're wondering why there are no Courier tablets today, it's because Steve ""Chair Chucker"" Ballmer didn't want any hit products that weren't run off the Windows operating system.""Fuck this noise. Tiles, the people want TILES.""So, sure enough, the Courier was shelved in favor of Microsoft's Surface tablets, which were so innovative that nearly a billion dollars' worth of them sit unsold in warehouses right now.Christopher Daed is a tech industry veteran and also awesome.

But when I try to log into my account I get stuck in the logging in screen and can't log in. It seems like it's logging in but after it charges, I'm back at the same logging in page. I tried deleting Instagram and Facebook from my iPhone but I still have the problem.

Logged In Through Desktop But After A Few Minutes Desktop Version Also Says ""Something Went Wrong.same issues as everyone else. was able to login to the app after a couple of tries, attempted to change my password, but it kept erroring out and closing the app. i tried to login via the website and was successful using the new password. logged out and had to retry a few times on the site. tried logging back in on the app, get a message saying to check my internet connection.I am having the same problem! I thought somone hacked into my account, I was so scared. It's saying I have no connection and my password has been changed!Server error, got logged out automatically, and can't get in, oh well no instigram for the moment. At least it isn't me only.I got the same error message! ""You've been logged out of [username]. The account may have changed the password."" 

I was able to log in onto www.instagram.com on my laptop just fine with my current password. But I was still unable to log onto the app, on my iPhone and iPad, so I am guessing the app is going through some issues at the moment. Using the app, I tried to reset my password using either my email or Facebook. The received the email so that was a good sign but the password link wasn't working. ""Oops, an error occurred."" When I tried to reset with Facebook, I got the same error.

So folks, I think Instagram has some bugs to fix with the app.Mine wont let me log on and I got really worried. Im logged on using desktop but I cant get on using my phone. Glad to know im not the only one having problems.Logged me out and said my email or password was wrong .. When it's not, and then tells me my password has been changed. Is Instagram down or something ?dumb as hell, follow me on ig! joshy_tries. Oh wait...... dumbasses can't even get it going.Says the owner of the account changed the username and password...But I didn't? And now it says that there is an errorLog me out, it says no internet, ha ha ha, and wrong password! Whats up with IG?logged me out said my password was changed and now site down? hacked?Same thing. Even if you reset using website it says 'server error 5xx'""ANONYMOUS"" JUST HACKED IT AND SHUT IT DOWN, JUST LIKE THEY SHUT DOWN THE PS4 NETWORK THIS YEAR , THEY PROBABLY HACKING ISIS TOOLogged me out and scared the hell outta me, I could get in a couple times but in the end it forced me out. I tried again yet it said I had no internet connection (although my wifi is on and I have full strength.)It wont let me log back in either. Says internal error. Now I'm getting that my password has been changed.logged out of my app automatically. My password does not work. The desktop site tells me to ""connect to the internet"" and retry. Well I'm connected, and it gives the same error.Logged me out saying owner may have changed password and wouldn't let me log in. Then it now says that I am not connected to the Internet even though I know I am. :(Same as all others, logged me out, now won't accept password, ""unknown error"" messagesays account owner may have changed password and it won't let me log inLogged me out too, won't let me log back in even after a restart of the phone. desktop site still functional. May be an app issue.It randomly logged me out, telling me my password may have been changed. I requested a reset through my email and it gave me an error when I submitted the form, so it wasn't changed. I tried to log in with the same password I've had and it tells me it can't connect. The safari page doesn't work either.Logged out on app w/ message ""owner changed password"". But ok with Instagram.com. Thought I got hacked. App still down.It randomly logged me out saying the password was either changed or whatever and now i cant get back in and cant sign in and cant change my password...I was logged out, got a message that the owner may have changed the passwordSame here suddenly got logged out and can't log back in. Says unknown error. Everything else is fine...Forced Logged Out, ""User My Have Changed The Password"" Error Popped Up.Can't log in says it may have changed password but can't connect to Facebook or email to fix the issueWas logged out, stating maybe password was changed. Trying to log in online or on app, not able to do so on either.I can't login on either of my accounts. My art account, or my regular account. When I went on my phone it kicked me out, and now I can't login at all.mine says the user has changed the password which i have not done. wont let me log inApp kicked me out and then asked me to log back in. When I try to I get a pop up that says ""An unknown network error has occurred."" Everything else is working, so it's not my internet. Other people told me they're having the same issue.my posts wont publish to the feed of my followers, only on my page! so annoyingMy posts won't post to the feed/time line.

119,9626773,Google ATAP's Radar-Based Gesture Technology ‚ÄúProject Soli‚Äù,http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/05/29/google-ataps-radar-based-gesture-technology-project-soli-brings-minority-report-fantasies-one-step-closer-to-reality/,2015,"Before you read this article, do me a favor: watch the video below. Because it's going to explain what Google is doing here much better than I could hope to.Got it? Good. Pretty amazing, right?For those of you who can't or don't want to watch it, fine, I guess that's what writers are for or whatever! Project Soli is, at its root, a fingernail-sized radar chip and an advanced set of algorithms that interpret the data that the array feeds back into a connected device. The purpose of those algorithms is to analyze the fine-grain motions of your hands and fingers. See? My explanation makes it sound really boring, even though it's super awesome. This screengrab may get the point across a little more clearly.This mockup has someone controlling a color slider in a drawing app on a Nexus 9 without touching the screen. Simply by sliding their thumb against their forefinger, the device knows what the user is trying to do, and that's because the embedded radar chip (in concept, these demos are almost certainly not live) is taking the feedback it's getting in real time and using algorithms to understand that this is what the person's fingers are doing. It is that sensitive. Radar isn't something you're going to find in phones or tablets of today, because frankly, I don't think there's been a huge use for it. An array of this tiny size would have very limited range, and I don't think there are a whole lot of use cases for ultra-short-range mobile radar yet. ATAP thought differently, and began building Project Soli.To be clear, the implications here are amazing if Soli proves to be as practical and seamless as the demos make it look. Touching your smartwatch could be a thing of the past, as could controls in your vehicle, Bluetooth speakers, or really anything. How practical is it? I have no idea. How affordable is it? Again, no clue (I'm guessing the chips are not prohibitively costly, though). But wow. This is one of those things that could mark a real leap in how consumer electronics are designed and evolve. Let's hope Google can get it figured out. Also, yes, this really does bring us one step closer to Minority Report gesture magic.But seriously, WANTWANTWANTWANTSeriously, if the chip has the right resolution/range, the right power requirements, the software doesn't require extreme computational complexity, and the motion gestures are intuitive, this could be revolutionary.But those are some big hurdles.Black magic, brah. That shit's some black magic.it really does border on witchcrafthttp://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljrkeafgSl1qa8ir9o1_r1_500.gifYou're a hairy wizard.I work over internet, working some basic jobs that only requires from you a PC and internet connection and I am happier than ever... Six months have passed since i started this and i earned so far total of 36,000 bucks... Basicly i profit about $80/h and work for three to four hours on daily basis.And awesome thing about this job is that you can make your own schedule when you work and for how long and you get a paycheck at the end of every week. Yeah this is definitely at the level of Minority Report and Tony Stark/Iron Man type of insanity. Being able to manipulate virtual objects as precisely as the physical counterpart is as futuristic as one can imagine right now. Looks like the $12B Google paid for Motorola with the stipulation that ATAP would be theres when they sold it off is paying off over time.We will get to that level eventually. I just hope I'm still alive when it happens.It was my understanding that ATAP, in one form or another, has been around for many many years. What came out of the Motorola deal was the transference of Project Ara (and maybe a few others) from Moto to Google.The Motorola deal for Google was pretty genius. They purchased for $12B, sold the tv setup division to Arris off for $2.4B almost right away. They were able to get a $700m tax credit, sold other parts of Motorola to Lenovo for $3B, keeps all the patents and gets all the tech and people that are part of ATAP.Surprising that some very good engineers have such strong business savvy.It was even better than that! ... they actually broke even on the deal, while keeping ATAP and the patents! ssssh! :)radar detectors are also illegal in many countries....even on that scale?dunno, laws are made by lawyers, so they tend to be illogical and rigidIt's not the radar that's illegal, it's that the frequencies are not assigned for civilian use. I don't think it's actually a radar, but the term here is used as a synonymous of ""detecting device"".I wish I were born 100 years later so I could experience some of the greatest breakthrough of science and technology...You live in the internet age, it's a pretty fucking interesting time to be alive.Google just needs to invent time travel so we don't have to waitlolI just need my great great great great grandson to send me a phone from the year 2500.At that time, we might finally see 40 FPS in Dolphin Emulator :Dyou would think the same thing a hundreds years from now, and the same if you lived a hundred years agoBy then we will be taken over by ISIS after they take over Pakistan and secure their nuclear weapons and use them to blow up western civilization power centers.The world wide web; the large hadron collider; discovery of the Higg's boson; the electric car; the birth of private space flight; completion of the Human Genome Project; stem cell research; the first living bacteria with a fully synthetic genome; self-driving cars; the mapping of (more or less) the entire world - available at no cost, to anyone with an internet connection; yeah. It really is a boring time to be alive.Never said it was boring, but most of what you listed will get true benefit long after we are gone. Of course the same will apply in 100 years for discoveries made then. Today's breakthrougs are tomorrow's achievements.What kind of contest did you have to win (within AP) to get to write about ATAP David?I woke up this morningGoogle has accomplished more in 16 years than any other company...imagine another 16 years.Take a look at good 16 years from now :
https://youtu.be/_kBlH-DQsEgAwesome, but can't help thinking, now we'll be powering a tiny radar as well as everything else on the darn things? OEM's have had enough time to make the OS and hardware sip power, the real challenge is the battery OEM's to come up with more efficient and longer lasting sources of power.Yes, we've seen announcements of various ""breakthroughs"" but those getting to a practical level of application still seems far off, or one wonders if the current set of Batt OEM's like to stifle such advances.Unfortunately, along with trying to get the thing to last longer, we need to worry about the same thing as the HW vendor - Elimination of heat, hard to do int he phone size device which in most cases gets stuck into a case (see what I did there? :) )What if screens don't need to be touch-enabled any longer? I don't know if the fact that they are uses much power but maybe that trade could be made...Ubuntu: DCame here for this :DMind. Blown.No more smeared touch screens! :)This is millimeter wave detection. I believe it's similar to the mm-wave scanners in airports. 60 GHz is in the license free spectrum. I wonder how this will conflict with IEEE 802.11ad WiGi specificationInteresting, but I can't shake the feeling that this will be abused by pranksters. How will it know it's your hand that's gesturing and not someone else's? Or if you got kids like me, I can imagine them fighting over the volume or something (and this time there's no remote to take away).The technology isn't magic - it needs a device to be nearby that is emitting the radar signal.I know that but still, it's going to be an issue depending on functional distance and dysfunctional persons ;-)No more of an issue than already exists with voice controls and people being able to simply reach out and touch your screen uninvited.REAL LIFE SAO MENUS GOGOGOBy far the coolest thing shown at I/O this year, a serious game changer, I want it in my watch RIGHT NOW!Isn't it fascinating how well timed things like the recent push for consumer VR and the development of this technology emerge.
However, a similar technology is already available from Leap Motion. It makes you wonder why it never quite caught on. Was Leap too early to the game? Will technology backed by a giant like Google do better?
That said, I do find it fascinating! It also actually even looks convenient. If this ever hits consumer electronics it will have a deep impact on computer interaction like the mouse, then the touchpad and the touchscreen had. Tip:
Watching the video and actually repeating the gestures and imagining that you're controlling the interface shown makes it really immersive. We should look forward to this and encourage Google to push this technology!Leap Motion is a totally different technology - much closer to the Kinect than to this.Getting rid of interface hardware would be good. Not sure this is it, but at least the search continues!This is the next step on from the (IR-based) technology in the Moto X (2nd Gen); will be ideal for Google Glass (2nd Gen) ...Isn't this just Leap Motion miniaturised?If you'd bothered with a 2 minute Google you could have answered this for yourself (no, it's not even remotely similar technology).Now all we need is a hologram smartwatch!!! I can see it now :)Which phone do you think ""won"" at MWC 2017?View Results Discuss This Poll"

		1. He's going to build a Tesla Supercharger station in the parking lot of the museum.
		
		2. He's donating $1 million dollars to the museum itself.
	Elon Musk: from the deepest wells of my geeky little heart: thank you. 


Dancing Matt

	I want to give a big thanks to Matt Harding for first convincing me to buy a Model S, 
	and then later helping me write the review of it. 
 	Matt is the friend with the solar panels on his house whose car is powered by the motherfreakin' sun.
	
	Matt Harding likes to dance a lot, 
	and sometimes we do important science together.
	
Why $8M?

	It's been a year since we officially closed on Wardenclyffe, and after getting countless estimates from site planners, architects, 
	and museum curators from all around the world, 
	we determined that $8M is the bare minimum to build, staff, and maintain a Nikola Tesla Museum.
	While we'd be grateful for any amount, any less than $8M would pretty much leave us in the same boat we're in now. 
	
	
	
Is there anything I can do to help?

Buying Tesla stock couldn't hurt, 
	although a much cheaper strategy might be to simply get the word out and 
	 let Tesla Motors or Elon Musk
	know that you support this idea. 
	
	You can also donate to the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.

Carlos
  Valdes Lora



  Whistle-blower Edward Snowden has some strong opinions on
  communications ‚Äî even when those communications are coming from
  aliens.

  The former intelligence-agency contractor turned fugitive was an
  unexpected guest on famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson's
  
  StarTalk podcast on September 18. And, inevitably, the two
  got to talking about extraterrestrials.

  Snowden became an infamous household name in 2013 when he leaked
  classified documents divulging the government's top-secret
  mass-surveillance program, which involved collecting personal
  information on Americans via phone records without their
  knowledge.

  When the news broke, the US charged him with theft and espionage,
  and he's now living in Russia where he has asylum.

  But Tyson scored an interview with him in New York City. How?
  Snowden rigged a robot that he can control from Russia, and
  rolled right into Tyson's office at the Hayden Planetarium in New
  York with his face displayed on the screen.

  The conversation turned to encryption and cybersecurity, but
  here's where an astrophysicist differs from a journalist:
  Tyson's line of questioning quickly turned to how
  encryption relates to communication with ... aliens.

  Tyson asked Snowden if a highly intelligent alien civilization
  might be communicating with encrypted messages. And Snowden had
  an unsettling answer.

  First, Snowden said, let's assume that most advanced societies
  eventually realize that they need to encrypt their communication
  in order to protect it. This could also be the reason why we've
  never heard from other civilizations ‚Äî their messages may have
  just been melding into the background static of the universe.

  Here's Snowden's full answer, 
  from the StarTalk podcast:

  So if you have an alien civilization trying to listen for other
  civilizations, or our civilization trying to listen for aliens,
  there's only one small period in the development of their society
  when all of their communication will be sent via the most
  primitive and most unprotected means.

  So when we think about everything that we're hearing through our
  satellites or everything that they're hearing from our
  civilization (if there are indeed aliens out there), all of their
  communications are encrypted by default.

  So what we are hearing, that's actually an alien television show
  or, you know, a phone call ... is indistinguishable to us from
  cosmic microwave background radiation.
So it could be possible there are alien messages
  constantly hitting our satellites, and we just don't recognize
  them because they're so heavily encrypted. (The cosmic
  microwave background radiation that Snowden mentions is thermal
  radiation throughout the universe left over from the Big Bang. It
  basically looks and sounds like static to us puny humans.)

  Of course, that's assuming an alien civilization has the same
  security issues that we have here on Earth, and they need to
  worry about protecting their communication system from their
  alien governments, Tyson jokes.

  Snowden agreed that aliens might be a little more politically
  sophisticated than us.

Ryan Block, formerly of Engadget and now at AOL, called Comcast to cancel his service, but instead of politely obliging and going ahead with his request, the representative on the line insisted on taking him through a circular argument to find out the reason why he was canceling service.Block was able to capture about eight minutes of the call and has posted the audio to his Soundcloud account for the rest of us to enjoy (or sympathize with, if you've been in that situation before). It's pretty painful to listen to, and even though it sounds like something straight out of a hidden camera TV show, Block insists that it was not a prank (he even asked the rep during the call if it was indeed a prank). Grab a cup of coffee and give a listen to the call below.Comcast responded to the matter by telling The Hollywood Reporter that it will directly contact Block and that it is ""very embarrassed by the way our employee spoke with [him]."" The company says that ""the way in which our representative communicated with him is unacceptable and not consistent with how we train our customer service representatives"" and it is also ""investigating this situation and will take quick action.""Update 7/15 12:15PM ET: Added Comcast's response.The Folio Society‚Äôs edition of the book has new illustrations from the Sandman cover artistI met a traveler from an antique land...Yet another cinematic universeLots of people wear thick glasses, you knowLet‚Äôs talk about the news"

This post originally appeared on Naoki‚Äôs Medium blog¬†and has been republished with permission.Update: PayPal has denied¬†that its customer service representative divulged credit card information over the phone. GoDaddy has admitted partial responsibility for the incidents. Finally, the @N account itself is actually in someone else‚Äôs hands, after Twitter made it available after initially deactivating it.TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017.I had a rare Twitter username, @N. Yep, just one letter. I‚Äôve been offered as much as $50,000 for it. People have tried to steal it. Password reset instructions are a regular sight in my email inbox.As of today, I no longer control @N. I was extorted into giving it up.While eating lunch on January 20, 2014, I received a text message from PayPal for one-time validation code. Somebody was trying to steal my PayPal account. I ignored it and continued eating.Later in the day, I checked my email which uses my personal domain name (registered with GoDaddy) through Google Apps. I found the last message I had received was from GoDaddy with the subject ‚ÄúAccount Settings Change Confirmation.‚Äù There was a good reason why that was the last one.From: <support@godaddy.com> GoDaddy

Subject: Account Settings Change ConfirmationDear naoki hiroshima,You are receiving this email because the Account Settings were modified for the following Customer Account:XXXXXXXXThere will be a brief period before this request takes effect.If these modifications were made without your consent, please log in to your account and update your security settings.If you are unable to log in to your account or if unauthorized changes have been made to domain names associated with the account, please contact our customer support team for assistance: support@godaddy.com or (480) 505-8877.Please note that Accounts are subject to our Universal Terms of Service.Sincerely,
GoDaddyI tried to log in to my GoDaddy account, but it didn‚Äôt work. I called GoDaddy and explained the situation. The representative asked me the last 6 digits of my credit card number as a method of verification.This didn‚Äôt work because the credit card information had already been changed by an attacker. In fact, all of my information had been changed. I had no way to prove I was the real owner of the domain name.The GoDaddy representative suggested that I fill out a case report on GoDaddy‚Äôs website using my government identification. I did that and was told a response could take up to 48 hours. I expected that this would be sufficient to prove my identity and ownership of the account.Most websites use email as a method of verification. If your email account is compromised, an attacker can easily reset your password on many other websites. By taking control of my domain name at GoDaddy, my attacker was able to control my email.I soon realized, based on my previous experiences being attacked, that my coveted Twitter username was the target. Strangely, someone I don‚Äôt know sent me a Facebook message encouraging me to change my Twitter email address.I assumed this was sent from the attacker but I changed it regardless. The Twitter account email address was now one which the attacker could not access.The attacker tried to reset my Twitter password several times and found he couldn‚Äôt receive any of the reset emails because it took time for the change of my domain‚Äôs MX record, which controls the email domain server. The attacker opened issue #16134409 at Twitter‚Äôs Zendesk support page.N, Jan 20 01:43 PM:Twitter username: @n
Your email: *****@*****.***

Mobile number (optional): n/a
Anything else? (optional): I‚Äôm not receiving the password reset to my email, do you think you could manually send me one?Twitter required the attacker to provide more information to proceed and the attacker gave up on this route.I later learned that the attacker had compromised my Facebook account in order to bargain with me. I was horrified to learn what had happened when friends began asking me about strange behavior on my Facebook account.I received an email from my attacker at last.

Subject: RE: ‚Ä¶helloI got it in the first call, most agents will just keep trying until they get itHe was lucky that he only had to guess two numbers and was able to do it in a single call. The thing is, GoDaddy allowed him to keep trying until he nailed it. Insane. Sounds like I was dealing with a wannabe Kevin Mitnick‚Äîit‚Äôs as though companies have yet to learn from his Mitnick‚Äôs exploits circa 1995.With my GoDaddy account restored, I was able to regain access to my email as well. I changed the email address I use at several web services to an @gmail.com address. Using my Google Apps email address with a custom domain feels nice but it has a chance of being stolen if the domain server is compromised. If I were using an @gmail.com email address for my Facebook login, the attacker would not have been able to access my Facebook account.If you are using your Google Apps email address to log into various websites, I strongly suggest you stop doing so. Use an @gmail.com for logins. You can use the nicer custom domain email for messaging purposes, I still do.In addition, I also strongly suggest you to use a longer TTL for the MX record, just in case. It was 1 hour TTL in my case and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt have enough time to keep receiving emails to the compromised domain after losing the DNS control. If it was a week-long TTL for example, I would have had a greater chance to recover the stolen accounts.Using two-factor authentication is a must. It‚Äôs probably what prevented the attacker from logging into my PayPal account. Though this situation illustrates that even two-factor authentication doesn‚Äôt help for everything.Stupid companies may give out your personal information (like part of your credit card number) to the wrong person. Some of those companies are still employing the unacceptable practice of verifying you with the last some digits of your credit card.To avoid their imprudence from destroying your digital life, don‚Äôt let companies such as PayPal and GoDaddy store your credit card information. I just removed mine. I‚Äôll also be leaving GoDaddy and PayPal as soon as possible.Editor‚Äôs Note: The Next Web has reached out to GoDaddy, PayPal, and Twitter for comment.‚Äî PayPal says it did not release any credit card, personal or financial information for the account in question.‚Äî A Twitter spokesperson¬†tells us: ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt comment on individual accounts, we are investigating the report.‚Äù‚Äî GoDaddy Chief Information Security Officer Todd Redfoot provided the following statement:Our review of the situation reveals that the hacker was already in possession of a large portion of the customer information needed to access the account at the time he contacted GoDaddy. The hacker then socially engineered an employee to provide the remaining information needed to access the customer account. The customer has since regained full access to his GoDaddy account, and we are working with industry partners to help restore services from other providers. We are making necessary changes to employee training to ensure we continue to provide industry-leading security to our customers and stay ahead of evolving hacker techniques.Don‚Äôt miss:¬†How to stop giving a f@$% what people thinkAnd:¬†Four months ago I completely quit lying. Here‚Äôs how it dramatically and positively transformed my life.

131,10114791,How to Calculate Customer Acquisition Cost,http://tuneseidelin.com/how-to-calculate-customer-acquisition-cost/,2015,"Tune SeidelinBy Tune Seidelin One of the secrets to an unlimited marketing budget, is knowing how to calculate customer acquisition cost (CAC).And by the end of this post, you‚Äôll know exactly how to go about it‚Ä¶Plus I‚Äôll reveal little known details that‚Äôll give you an almost unfair advantage over 99% of your competition (because they are clueless about these things).Now let‚Äôs get started‚Ä¶The calculation is very simple ‚Äì just use this ‚Äúcustomer acquisition cost formula‚Äù:Money Spend on Customer Acquisition ¬†/ Number of New Customers = Customer Acquisition CostAnd if you actually do the calculation for your business.Then you‚Äôre already ahead of most of the competition.Because most business owners don‚Äôt know this number.But to get the most of this very useful metric, we have to get a little more advanced than this.First of all you‚Äôll have to know‚Ä¶Have you ever heard this quote?‚ÄúHalf the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don‚Äôt know which half.‚Äù
‚Äì John WanamakerWanamaker¬†points to a very real problem for many business owners.But if he¬†knew what I‚Äôm about to tell you, his problem would be solved‚Ä¶You see, if you use the above formula for each customer source in your business¬†(just remember to set up tracking mechanisms, so you know where each customer comes from and how much you spend on each source).And you know how to calculate customer lifetime value.Then you‚Äôll instantly see where you are wasting money and where you are getting a good return on your investment.Now imagine what would happen to your profits, if you eliminated all sources that is costing you money and started spending the difference on the sources that actually make money‚Ä¶(I‚Äôve seen unprofitable businesses become profitable. And already successful businesses triple their profits. Just using¬†this simple strategy).Pretty exciting, right?And now that you¬†know how to calculate customer acquisition cost.All you have to do is start using this metric to increase profits in your business.And if you own a business that does at least ‚Ç¨250K in sales per year (or the equivalent in another currency).Then I‚Äôll be happy to take a look at your customer acquisition strategy and tell you exactly what you can do to increase profits.And it isn't going to cost you a single cent.Why?Because I'm currently looking for business owners to partner with (who wants to increase profits and are happy to pay for performance).And by helping you for free, I get to know you and your business (that's how I find out if there are hidden assets and overlooked opportunities in your business that I can help turn into windfall profits and new recurring income streams).So if the opportunities I discover are big enough, I might offer to help you implement for a part of the additional and measurable profits I create for you (that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise).(I can't promise anything. I can only work on a small handful of businesses at the time. And I'm very picky about who I work with.)But if that sounds good to you, then fill out the form below (so I can show you how to increase profits in your business).Talk soon,

132,7270775,How Using a Decision Journal can Help you Make Better Decisions,http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/02/decision-journal/,2014,"
Over 400,000 people visited Farnam Street last month to learn how to make better decisions, create new ideas, and avoid stupid errors. With more than 100,000 subscribers to our popular weekly digest, we've become an online intellectual hub. To learn more about what we do, start here.
People often ask me how they can¬†improve their ability to make decisions over time. This question makes a lot of sense. After all, in most¬†knowledge organizations, your product is decisions.We all have a vested interest in getting better at decisions. As an entrepreneur, I live and¬†die by my decisions. I'm not alone. In almost any organization, you are the result of your decisions.¬†While good decisions might not get you promoted, bad ones will almost certainly get you fired.One reason we struggle to get better at making¬†decisions is because¬†we rarely receive feedback on the quality of our decisions. Think about it, there is no Yelp for decision ability where you can leave a review. It's like¬†we're operating a restaurant but the customers¬†can't give us feedback.¬†So we never learn that the steak has too much salt or the spaghetti has too much sauce. Because we can't learn and get better, we go out of business. ¬†Good decisions don't ensure success but bad ones almost always ensure failure.The way to test the quality of your decisions, whether individually or organizationally, is by testing the process by which they are made. The best way to do that, according to the dean of biases and Nobel winner, Daniel Kahneman, is to use a decision journal. Kahneman said:Go down to a local drugstore and buy a very cheap notebook and start keeping track of your decisions. And the specific idea is whenever you're making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just take a moment to think, write down what you expect to happen, why you expect it to happen and then actually, and this is optional, but probably a great idea, is write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and even emotionally. Just, how do you feel? I feel tired. I feel good, or this stock is really draining me. Whatever you think.The key to doing this is that it prevents something called hindsight bias, which is no matter what happens in the world, we tend to look back on our decision-making process, and we tilt it in a way that looks more favorable to us, right? So we have a bias to explain what has happened.A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking as you made the decisions. This also helps us see when we're lucky. Sometimes¬†things work out for very different reasons than we thought they would. The key to understanding¬†the limits to our¬†knowledge (see: circle of competence) is to check it¬†against what you thought was going to happen and why you thought it was going to happen. That feedback loop is incredibly powerful because our minds won't do it by themselves. I'll give you the spoiler right now. We don't know as much as we think we know. We're fooled into thinking that we understand something when we don't and we have no means to correct ourselves.Our minds revise history to preserve our view of ourself. The¬†story that we tell ourselves¬†conflates the cause and effect between a decision that we made and the actual outcome. The best cure for this is the decision journal.Decision JournalsYou can think of a decision journal as quality control ‚Äî something like we'd find in a manufacturing plant or a restaurant.Conceptually this is pretty easy but it requires some discipline and humility to implement and maintain. In an interview I did with¬†Michael Mauboussin he offered some great advice:The idea is whenever you are making a consequential decision, write down what you decided, why you decided as you did, what you expect to happen, and if you‚Äôre so inclined, how you feel mentally and physically.The act of writing alone helps you. Carol Loomis once said:Writing itself makes you realize where there are holes in things. I'm never sure what I think until I see what I write. And so I believe that, even¬†though you're an optimist, the analysis part of you kicks in when you sit down [to write] ‚Ä¶ You think, ‚ÄòOh, that can't be right.' And you have to go back, and you have to rethink it all.What does a Decision Journal Look like?Here's mine. (Click on the image for a printable pdf).¬†Whenever you're making a consequential decision either individually or as part of a group you take a moment and write down:¬†Things are complicated, I get it. Here are some tips to keep in mind as you implement your decision journal.Journals¬†can be tailored to the situation and context. Specific decisions might include tradeoffs, second order effects, weighting criteria, or other relevant factors. This is only to get you started.Don't spend too much time on the brief and obvious insight. Often these first thoughts are system one, not system two. William¬†Deresiewicz said these first thoughts¬†represent the thinking of someone else and not our own thinking.Any decision you're journaling is inherently complex and may involve non-linear systems. In such a world small effects can cause disproportionate responses whereas bigger ones can have no impact. Remember that causality is complex, especially in complex domains.There are two¬†common ways people wiggle out of their own decision: hindsight bias and jargon.I know we live in an age of computers but you simply must do this by hand because that will help reduce the odds of hindsight bias. It's easy to look at a print-out and say, I didn't see it that way. It's a lot harder to look at your own writing and say the same thing.Another thing to avoid is vague and ambiguous wording. If you're talking in abstractions and fog, you're not ready to make a decision, and you'll find it easy to change the definitions to suit new information. This is where writing down the probabilities as you see them comes into play.***Your decision journal¬†should be reviewed on a regular basis‚Äîevery six months or so. The review is an important part of the process. This is where you can get better. Realizing where you make mistakes, how you make them, what types of decisions you're bad at, etc. will help you make better decisions if you're rational enough. This is also where a coach can help. If you share your journal with someone, they can review it with you and help identify areas for improvement.And keep in mind it's not all about outcome. You might have made the right decision (which, in our sense means a good process) and had a bad outcome. We call that a bad break.Odds are you're going to discover two things right away. First, you're right a lot of the time. Second, it's often for the wrong reasons. This can be somewhat humbling.

133,7503571,Debugging Asynchronous JavaScript with Chrome DevTools,http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/async-call-stack/,2014,"A powerful feature that makes JavaScript unique is its ability to work 
asynchronously via callback functions. Assigning async callbacks let you write 
event-driven code but it also makes tracking down bugs a hair pulling experience 
since the JavaScript is not executing in a linear fashion.Luckily, now in Chrome  DevTools, 
you can view the full call stack of 
asynchronous JavaScript callbacks!(We'll break down the flow of this demo soon.)Once you enable the async call stack feature in DevTools, you will be able to 
drill into the state of your web app at various points in time. Walk the full 
stack trace for some event listeners, setInterval, setTimeout, XMLHttpRequest, 
promises, requestAnimationFrame, MutationObservers, and more.As you walk the stack trace, you can also analyze the value of any variable at 
that particular point of runtime execution. It's like a time machine for your 
watch expressions!Let's enable this feature and take a look at a few of these scenarios.Try out this new feature by enabling it in Chrome. Go to the Sources panel of Chrome Canary DevTools.Next to the Call Stack panel on the right hand side, there is a new checkbox 
for ""Async"". Toggle the checkbox to turn async debugging on or off. (Although 
once it's on, you may not ever want to turn it off.)You've probably seen this before in Gmail:If there is a problem sending the request (either the server is having problems 
or there are network connectivity issues on the client side), Gmail will 
automatically try re-sending the message after a short timeout.To see how async call stacks can help us analyze delayed timer events and XHR 
responses, I've recreated that flow with a mock Gmail 
example. The full JavaScript code can 
be found in the link above but the flow is as follows:By solely looking at the Call Stack panel in previous versions of DevTools, a 
breakpoint within postOnFail() would give you little information about where 
postOnFail() was being called from. But look at the difference when turning on 
async stacks:Here you can see that postOnFail() was initiated from an AJAX callback but no further info.Here you can see that the XHR was initiated from submitHandler(). Nice!With async call stacks turned on, you can view the entire call stack to easily 
see if the request was initiated from submitHandler() (which happens after clicking the submit button) or from
retrySubmit() (which happens after a setTimeout() delay):When you walk the full call stack, your watched expressions will also update to 
reflect the state that it was in at that time!In addition to simply watching expressions, you can interact with your code from previous scopes right in the DevTools JavaScript console panel.Imagine that you are Dr. Who and you need a little help comparing the clock from before you got into the Tardis to ""now"". From the DevTools console, you can easily evaluate, store, and do calculations on values from across different execution points.Staying within DevTools to manipulate your expressions will save you time from having to switch back to your source code, make edits, and refresh the browser.If you thought the previous mock Gmail flow was hard to unravel without the async 
call stack feature enabled, can you imagine how much harder it would be with 
more complex asynchronous flows like chained promises? Let's revisit the final 
example of Jake Archibald's tutorial on 
JavaScript Promises.Here's a little animation of walking the call stacks in Jake's 
async-best-example.html
example.Notice how the Call Stack panel is pretty short on info when trying to debug promises.Wow! Such promises. Much callbacks.Let's go deeper into the HTML5Rocks archives. Remember Paul Lewis' 
Leaner, Meaner, Faster Animations with requestAnimationFrame?Open up the 
requestAnimationFrame 
demo
and add a breakpoint at the beginning of the update() method (around line 874) of 
post.html. With async call stacks we get a lot more insights into 
requestAnimationFrame, including the ability to walk all 
the way back to the initiating scroll event callback.MutationObserver allow us to observe changes in the DOM. In this 
simple example,
when you click on the button, a new DOM node is appended to 
<div class=""rows""></div>.Add a breakpoint within nodeAdded() (line 31) in demo.html. With async call 
stacks enabled, you can now walk the call stack back through addNode() to the 
initial click event.If you tend to assign all of your callbacks as anonymous functions, you may wish 
to instead give them a name to make viewing the call stack easier.For example, take an anonymous function like this:And give it a name like windowLoaded():When the load event fires, it will show up in the DevTools stack trace with its 
function name instead of the cryptic ""(anonymous function)"". This makes it 
much easier to see at a glance what's happening in your stack trace.To recap, these are all the asynchronous callbacks in which DevTools will 
display the full call stack:Being able to see the full stack trace of your JavaScript callbacks should keep 
those hairs on your head. This feature in DevTools will be especially helpful 
when multiple async events happen in relation to each other, or if an uncaught 
exception is thrown from within an async callback.Give it a try in Chrome. 
If you have feedback on this new feature, drop us a line on the 
Chrome DevTools bug tracker
or in the 
Chrome DevTools 
Group.

We're a London based startup that develops Construct 2, software that lets you make your own computer games!
Join us! Joiiinnn ussss! Mooooree brains!Recently Apple released iOS 6, the new version of the operating system for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. For us the most notable new feature is the Safari browser now supports the Web Audio API. This is the same audio engine used by Chrome, allowing for low-latency, high-performance polyphonic audio playback. Typically Safari has had such strict limitations on audio it was effectively impossible to play sound effects in a game - but this is no more! Unfortunately Safaris' Web Audio API is not backwards-compatible with existing games, but we've fixed it for next build, bar one small restriction (more on that in a moment).At last, this means there is a major mobile browser that has good support for HTML5 games! iOS 5 introduced a hardware-accelerated canvas for high-performance games in Safari, but the audio limitations meant there would basically be no sound effects - and who wants to publish a game without sound? Now that Safari can play audio properly, you can run GPU-accelerated games with full audio support right from the Safari browser. What's more is you can also design iOS web apps which run from the home screen, looking like native apps, but circumvent the 30% cut that Apple take on their store. Ensuring people find your game may be more difficult if you're not in the App Store, but others are saying iOS 6 could make it harder to find your game anyway - another reason to go on the web.For a demo, check out this touch enabled version of Space Blaster:http://www.scirra.com/labs/spaceblastertouchIf you have an iOS device try visiting the URL in Safari and having a play - then try adding it to the home screen and using it like a native app. And thanks to Construct 2's offline support, it'll work even without an internet connection.Now for that limitation - Safari mutes all audio until you touch the screen, presumably to stop websites immediately blaring unwanted music at you. To work around this the Audio object will queue up any sounds played before the screen is touched, then play them on the first touch. After that, all sound will work normally. To work around this we've also introduced a 'touch to begin' screen before the main title. When you touch on this screen it will play a sound (therefore unmuting the Web Audio API), and the title music and rest of the game will continue to play as expected.The performance may not be perfectly native-like yet, but it is definitely good enough for a large class of games. Also, iOS will keep improving, newer faster devices will be released, and we'll keep tuning our engine for maximum performance, so it will only get better.We believe this is a strong sign that the web is increasingly becoming a viable platform for publishing games - even for mobile. It does seem to have been neglected in the past in favour of the app stores, but this may have largely been because mobile browsers provided such a poor experience. Now Apple have a mobile browser robust enough to play HTML5 games, we can expect ever-competitive Android to catch up in the near future. And the upcoming Windows 8 Phones have great HTML5 support too.So when publishing your next game, take a moment to consider the web. There are some interesting advantages to it. You don't have to jostle for attention in App Stores - the web can be the platform.Awesome news!!!Construct2 is by far the best game creator tool out there :)Great work.Well the possibilities keep getting greater at every turn. This is great news for all of us.Good work, Scirra team, and a really good choice for choosing html as a platform for games! Looking forward for new good news from you little factory of awesomeness!This is a very interesting new step, I haven't really considered games on an iOS device that aren't from the app store.Really interesting optionI've worked on ios apps before, and I will be more than happy to circumvent their app store, thanks for the heads up!Great article! Every day it seems another brick falls out of the wall that hinders HTML5 from seeing it's full potential.Wow, the mobile platform really support HTML5 day by day. Greatt!!Android 4.1, iOS6, BlackBerry Playbook OS 2.1, Windows Phone 8 was great HTML5 mobile platform. Really convince me to focus on HTML5 Game Development.Plus the new OS from Microsoft, Windows 8 Metro Apps support HTML5 too. :)I'm also hope for upcoming open source mobile OS from Intel and Samsung, ""TIZEN"" (developer.tizen.org/) keep their support for HTML5 plaftorm too.And i hope @Ashley @Tom and Scirra will prepare for the features 'export project' to TIZEN for short/long term plan. ^^That's good but how do you monetize a web game? If someone buys it from the app store, that's money in your pocket. Where's the money in putting it on a web page?It's a good coments that Scirra Team prepare for us.

135,7057374,Google: Destroying Shareholder Value One Cent At A Time,http://seekingalpha.com/article/1944031-google-destroying-shareholder-value-one-cent-at-a-time?source=email_rt_article_readmore,2014,"This morning, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported an acquisition of Nest Labs for $3.2bn. For those who haven't heard of it, Nest was set up by ex- Apple employees to modernize and re-design standard household implements, beginning with the thermostat.Before I look at this deal in more detail, I would like to state that I think both Google and Nest are tremendous companies. Google is a stock I would happily put into my kid's trust fund, while I have found the Nest thermostat a fantastic product in all regards. Still, as much as I love a porterhouse from London's Hawksmoor, I wouldn't pay $500 for one!This acquisition will not significantly impact Google as this is a company with $58bn in the bank and expected net earnings of $15bn. The acquisition price of $3.2bn amounts to $11.56 per share, meaning that even if Nest is a complete turkey, the share will lose only 1% of it's current valuation, however in the UK we have a saying ""look after the pennies because the pounds look after themselves"".The CEO is already one of the wealthiest and most successful businessmen in the world and it is more likely than not that his interests do no align with shareholders but with gross overpayment of small acquisitions you have to wonder, is there a risk of Mr Page overpaying for a far larger asset?How do I conclude that this $3.2bn valuation was too rich; after all I think the product is incredible and I would (and have) these products in my own home?I will look at the estimated sales figures, the cost of development, the patent defensibility and the knock on effects of association with Google.Sales FiguresThese have not been given out privately and the FT have stated that the company have sold a few hundred thousand and during their last capital raising, it was stated they were selling forty thousand per month. Lets assume that they will sell 5 million units next year (growth of 1000% in one year), at $130 a go, we get sales of $650m, valuing the company at 5x Sales. This is a stretch assuming a huge stretch of sales (the current valuation is something like 50x sales!).Cost of DevelopmentNest Labs has been active for four years and employ more than one hundred people and so how quickly (and expensively) could incumbents like Honeywell or indeed Google (if they were to copy this idea)? The product is simple enough, a standard thermostat with some smart software behind it as well as a great design.I want to get my imitation to market quickly so I employ 1000 people (10x Nest's staff) at $200,000 per year. I think that a 100,000 square foot factory in the hearty of Mayfair ($120 per square foot per year) is an appropriate and cost effective base of manufacture. I pay Marc Jacobs $50m in cash to come up with a better design and then allocate Tesco's entire $160m marketing budget in order to get consumer traction. Finally, I decide that because my product is so great, I'm going to let my staff drink only Cristal with 10 bottles per staff member.With this enterprise, I am spending only $424m per year and so even if it takes 4 years, I have still come in at half the acquisition price!We have seen Instagram and Waze get picked up for $1bn and the difference here is that both companies had a user base. The thermostat market doesn't! The product is a great step forward for home automation but at the end of the day, there is nothing that is difficult to recreate at a reasonable price.Patent DefensibilityThe company bought a number of patents from Intellectual Ventures and is still involved in disputes with both Honeywell and Allure Energy but at the end of the day can you really patent a thermostat to copy competition.Maybe elements of the software can have a unique aspect to it but the simple truth is that the machine has a simple program that follows your energy consumption, optimizes it and allows wifi interaction. There is nothing that will stop rival companies developing a solution.. in fact, here are a fewTado, Honeywell, Hive, Ecobee.Association With GoogleAlthough Nest has come out and stated that data coming in through their products will remain with Nest and not Google, this won't change the fact that this will always remain a concern and a possibility. Both Spanish and French governments have already fined Google for data misuse with Holland potentially becoming another annoyed party.There will be a number of potential customers who will be put off by this potential data free for all, which will damage Nest to a small degree.Rounding up this article, Buffett once stated that you should buy a company that even an idiot can run, because sooner or latter, one will. I am not saying that Page is an idiot. He is an innovator, entrepreneur and genius. I am saying that this company is currently not operated in the best interests of shareholders and this overpriced acquisition proves it.I am pretty sure that if I conducted a survey between shareholders of whether they would want $11 cash or a share in a company valued at an EV/Sales of 50x with no moat I could safely predict the results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

Please update your browser permissions to allow them. The inside track on Washington politics. *Invalid email address The inside track on Washington politics. *Invalid email addressAmericans were angry when Wall Street‚Äôs greedy and risky behavior triggered a global financial crisis in 2008. They were angrier still when the government had to borrow and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest banks and the insurance company AIG. They were outraged when they found out that executives at those enterprises were continuing to receive big salaries and bonuses.So just imagine how outrageous it would be if some Wall Street sharpies went to court to argue that they didn‚Äôt benefit enough from the bailouts and that taxpayers should pay them tens of billions of dollars more.In fact, they did. And, according to legal observers, they just might prevail.‚ÄúLawsuits of the Rich and Shameless‚Äù is how the comedian Jon Stewart dubbed it.‚ÄúAn absurdist comedy .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. worthy of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks,‚Äù wrote John Cassidy, the New Yorker‚Äôs economics correspondent.For taxpayers, it looks to be another example of the old adage that no good deed goes unpunished.In two separate cases, the government now stands accused of overstepping its authority when it took extraordinary measures to prevent a financial meltdown in the fall of 2008. The Wall Street figures who are suing say their property was seized without compensation, in violation of the Constitution. One case was brought by Maurice ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Greenberg, the legendary former chief executive of AIG who built it into the world‚Äôs largest insurer. Filing the other case is a group of hedge funds that bought Fannie and Freddie stock for pennies per share after the companies were put in government conservatorship.Federal district court judges in Washington and New York initially dismissed both challenges. Their opinions noted, somewhat pointedly, that the Wall Street plaintiffs were not only unharmed but actually came out better off as a result of the government rescues. Yet both groups have now found a more sympathetic hearing a stone‚Äôs throw from the front gate of the White House, at a little-known brick courthouse called the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.There, Greenberg is asking the court to award him and other AIG shareholders at least $23 billion from the Treasury. He says that‚Äôs to compensate them for the 80 percent of AIG stock that the Federal Reserve demanded as a condition for its bailout. Judge Thomas Wheeler has repeatedly signaled his agreement with Greenberg. A decision is expected any day.In the Fannie and Freddie case, the decision is further off, with the trial set to begin in the fall. The hedge funds are challenging the government‚Äôs decision to confiscate all of the firms‚Äô annual profits, even if those profits exceed the 10 percent dividend rate that the Treasury had initially demanded. This ‚Äúprofit sweep‚Äù effectively prevents the firms from ever returning the government‚Äôs $187 billion in capital and freeing themselves from government control.Earlier this year, Judge Margaret Sweeney refused to dismiss the case and gave lawyers for the hedge funds the right to sift through the memos and e-mails of government officials involved. Within weeks, Fannie and Freddie shares, which had been trading at about $1.50, started trading as high as $3 based on rumors that the documents revealed inconsistencies in government officials‚Äô statements. The hedge funds are asking for the return of as much as $100 billion in profits and an end to the Treasury-imposed profit sweep. In her comments, Sweeney has shown sympathy with their argument that the government can‚Äôt hold them indefinitely in a legal limbo in which they have no claims to assets of the company they ostensibly own.When these cases were filed, many legal observers thought they were a long shot, even frivolous.¬†But from their procedural rulings and comments from the bench, said David Zaring, a professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of Business, both judges have indicated they are at least open to the plaintiffs‚Äô legal theories and willing to hold the government accountable for what it did during the financial crisis.‚ÄúI think people‚Äôs views have changed,‚Äù Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond Law School, said of the AIG case.¬†Greenberg‚Äôs lawyers, he said, ‚Äúwere able to present evidence and persuade the judge that there were some serious issues here.¬†It‚Äôs possible the judge could rule in their favor in some way.‚ÄùEven before the final papers for AIG‚Äôs bailout were signed, in September 2008, one shareholder was already agitating against it.Hank Greenberg had been forced out as chairman and chief executive in 2005 after state and federal regulators uncovered that the company had been engaged in sham transactions that allowed AIG and its corporate customers to manipulate reported earnings, avoid taxes, evade regulatory requirements and hide risks and liabilities from shareholders. Ever since, Greenberg has been on a mission to restore his reputation and regain control of the company that he had ruled over with an iron hand for 37 years.Even in exile, Greenberg remained AIG‚Äôs most important shareholder, controlling 20 percent of the company‚Äôs stock. He successfully sued some AIG executives in court and recruited away others to build his own rival insurance company. He also agreed to pay $15 million to settle civil charges brought against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though he refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing.Greenberg has repeatedly claimed that if he‚Äôd still been in charge, AIG would never have gotten into the mess it did. But that is impossible to know. What is known, however, is that when Greenberg was in charge, he ran the company ‚Äúas if it were a feudal state .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. disdainful of modern concepts of internal controls and regulatory compliance,‚Äù according to one person with intimate knowledge of the company‚Äôs management. After his firing, AIG paid $1.6 billion to settle multiple counts of accounting fraud brought by the SEC.What is also known is that the two lines of business that were the source of AIG‚Äôs major problems during the 2008 crisis were launched on his watch. He helped to create their risky business models and strategies, which were based on playing one regulator off another and engaging in complex financial arrangements between regulated subsidiaries and a largely unregulated parent company. And both business lines took root in the same clever rules-bending corporate culture that had always been Greenberg‚Äôs trademark.‚ÄúThe AIG which came begging to the Fed‚Äôs doorstep was the AIG that Hank Greenberg built,‚Äù said James Millstein, the Treasury official who oversaw AIG‚Äôs restructuring. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs capital structure was opaque, it was heavily dependent on short-term funding, with a highly leveraged financial products subsidiary that had been organized to evade effective regulatory oversight.‚Äù Greenberg, he said, ‚Äúran the parent company like a hedge fund with a triple A rating.‚ÄùAs the financial crisis unfolded, AIG‚Äôs fundamental flaws were finally exposed. On the same week Lehman Brothers collapsed, desperate executives went to the Treasury and the Federal Reserve looking for a loan. Dozens of Fed officials were dispatched to AIG headquarters on Pine Street in lower Manhattan. Within days, they were convinced that without a substantial cash infusion, AIG would be forced to file for bankruptcy, threatening the solvency of a number of big banks in Europe and the United States.To avoid such a meltdown, the Fed agreed under its emergency authority to act as a lender of last resort, lending AIG an initial $85 billion. The terms were to be the same as AIG‚Äôs investment bankers had offered the previous week, without success, to private lenders ‚Äî a 14 percent interest rate and ownership of 80 percent of the company. With lawyers sitting in the next room ready to file a bankruptcy petition, AIG directors reluctantly agreed to the terms.In his current suit against the government ‚Äî which has generated 300 docket items, 70 depositions, 4,600 exhibits, 36 million pages of documents and testimony from two former Treasury secretaries and the former Fed chairman ‚Äî Greenberg has relied on the legal advice and representation of super-lawyer David Boies. Boies gained his megawatt status in the 1980s successfully defending IBM against the government‚Äôs effort to break it up, and in the 1990s prosecuting the government‚Äôs case to break up Microsoft. He also represented Al Gore in the Supreme Court case over the contested 2000 election. But few clients have been as lucrative as the litigious Greenberg, whom he has also represented in earlier disputes: Disputes with the New York attorney general. Disputes with the SEC. Disputes with AIG itself. Even a slander suit against former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer. Published estimates of Boies‚Äôs legal fees in all these cases run to well over $100 million.In challenging the government takeover, Boies has tried out a number of legal theories in different courts, spinning what federal judge Paul Engelmayer in New York mockingly called a tale of ‚Äúplunder .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. and treachery worthy of an Oliver Stone movie.‚ÄùIn Boies‚Äôs retelling of the AIG rescue, government officials deliberately set out to coerce and punish the giant insurer while offering cushy bailouts to big banks like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That ‚Äúequal protection for billionaires‚Äù argument had largely fallen on deaf ears, perhaps because the government‚Äôs treatment of AIG turned out to be hardly punitive. Once interest rates on the government‚Äôs loan were reduced and the whole arrangement renegotiated three years later, the government wound up earning less than 4 percent a year on what grew to become a $182 billion bailout. That‚Äôs not very different than its deals with the banks.The argument that finally caught Judge Wheeler‚Äôs attention, though, was more narrowly legalistic: the law authorizing the Fed to make emergency loans to private firms mentions charging interest but contains no explicit authority to take compensation in the form of stock.‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre right on that, we win,‚Äù Boies said in an interview last week. ‚ÄúIf we aren‚Äôt, we lose.‚ÄùBy basing his case on a challenge to the Fed‚Äôs authority, Boies told Wheeler that he doesn‚Äôt need to consider how things have turned out for AIG shareholders since the rescue. He need only ask the narrower question, what was AIG‚Äôs stock worth on that day in September 2008, when the stock was ‚Äúillegally‚Äù transferred to the government? Based on that day‚Äôs trading price on the New York Stock Exchange, that would be about $23 billion.Not so fast, replied the Justice Department lawyers.For one thing, they said, there was no coercion ‚Äî AIG directors voluntarily agreed to hand over the stock. Their choice that day was clear: They could either accept the Treasury‚Äôs terms and wind up with 20 percent of something, or decline help, go bankrupt and get 100 percent of nothing. Reluctantly, they chose 20 percent of something.And as to the $23 billion loss that Greenberg and other shareholders claim to have suffered, government lawyers pointed to the same stock market tables but drew a different conclusion. In the hours before the rescue terms were announced, AIG stock was trading as low as $1.25. After the announcement, the stock had tripled to $3.75. Greenberg should be thanking the government, they said, not suing it.But what seemed to government lawyers like a slam-dunk argument seemed irrelevant to Wheeler. If the government didn‚Äôt have the authority to take the stock in the first place, he asked during final arguments, then doesn‚Äôt the law require the government to return it?When Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson decided the government needed to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in August of 2008, he too had a choice: Under the law governing the federally chartered mortgage giants, he could either put them in receivership, under which they would be shut down and their assets used to pay off their creditors, or put them into conservatorship, under which the government would attempt to stabilize them and nurse them back to financial health. He chose conservatorship but urged Congress to take steps to ensure they never again emerged in a form giving shareholders all the profits and taxpayers all the risk.Both Paulson and the man who succeeded him, Timothy Geithner, have testified that it never occurred to them during the crisis that Fannie and Freddie might one day be able to fully repay the government or that there would be anything left over for shareholders by the time the conservatorship ended. But things turned out differently than they expected.Because of the success of the government rescue, and the near-total retreat of private lenders and guarantors from mortgage finance, Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability and solvency by the end of 2012 ‚Äî perhaps not coincidentally, at the very time the government swept all of their profits into the Treasury.What Paulson and Geithner also didn‚Äôt anticipate was that, despite a bipartisan consensus that the mortgage giants should be wound down, Congress would be unable to agree on a system to replace them. Democrats and their industry allies insist that some limited form of government guarantees are necessary to ensure the availability of affordable 30-year mortgages at fixed rates. Tea party Republicans are just as adamant they will not agree to any government guarantees that once again put taxpayers on the hook.While it is three hedge funds ‚Äî Perry Capital, Fairholme Fund and Pershing Square Capital, led by William Ackman ‚Äî that have sued the government, the outcome will likely affect all shareholders. These include a number of small banks that were encouraged by the Paulson Treasury to buy preferred shares in the months before Fannie and Freddie‚Äôs downfall, and tens of thousands of small, individual holders of common stock, including many former employees and retirees in the Washington area. Their claim is that Congress and the White House are using Fannie and Freddie to fund the federal budget.But James Parrott, a fellow at the Urban Institute, says the idea that these companies will ever emerge from conservatorship and be able to earn profits for their shareholders is a fantasy. Parrott, who advised the Obama White House on the sweep, says that even if Fannie and Freddie were allowed to use current profits to pay back the Treasury‚Äôs $187 billion investment, they would still have to raise hundreds of billions more to have the capital to operate independently.Other government officials say Fannie and Freddie‚Äôs profits are themselves a fiction, because they would not exist but for the government standing behind all of their financial obligations. If the Treasury were to charge them anything close to a market rate for its guarantee, there would be no profits.But that‚Äôs always been the case for Fannie and Freddie. From the beginning they were set up to be a unique hybrid: government-backed enterprises with private shareholders and private capital. Until Congress comes up with another arrangement, say lawyers for the shareholders, the profits are real and the shareholders are entitled to use them to pay down the Treasury‚Äôs investment and begin recapitalizing the company and paying themselves a dividend. By some estimates, that could happen in the next several years if profits continue at current levels.Government lawyers and officials dismiss such speculation. Under the law setting up the conservatorship, they argue, Fannie and Freddie‚Äôs shareholders are entitled to nothing. They have no right to sue in court. They are not entitled to vote on any corporate decisions. They are not entitled to a penny of the companies‚Äô profits or any proceeds from the sale of company assets. Not now, not ever. In effect, the government is claiming the right to operate Fannie and Freddie however it wants, for as long as it wants, until it‚Äôs ready to close them down for good.In an opinion last fall, Judge Royce Lamberth of U.S. District Court in Washington ultimately ruled that that was what Congress intended when it wrote the laws governing Fannie and Freddie but acknowledged that such a sweeping assertion of government powers may ‚Äúraise eyebrows or even engender a feeling of discomfort.‚Äù It will now be up to Sweeney and the Court of Claims to decide whether what Congress intended amounts to an illegal and unconstitutional taking.One thing is already known, however. In deciding whether shareholders or taxpayers will profit from government bailouts, judges Sweeney in the Fannie and Freddie case and Wheeler in the AIG case are unlikely to have the last word. With so many billions of dollars at stake, their decisions are almost certain to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.For Dennis Kelleher, a former Senate staffer and corporate litigator who heads an advocacy group for financial sector reform, it‚Äôs all just another example of Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúindefensible arrogance. .‚Äâ.‚Äâ.Wall Street lives in an alternative universe where at all times it‚Äôs heads I win, tails you lose.‚Äù   Correction: An earlier version of this article described James Parrott as having helped conceive of the profit sweep while working in the Obama White House.

137,8687262,FIN4 Wall Street phishing scheme detailed in new FireEye report,http://bgr.com/2014/12/02/fin4-wall-street-phishing-scheme/,2014,"A new advanced phishing scheme going after a specific type of target has been discovered by security firm FireEye, which detailed the cyber attack in a new report. Specifically, a highly educated group going by the name of FIN4 has been discovered to target certain Wall Street companies, looking to obtain sensitive information about certain companies, transactions, and special deals, in order to later make use of it for financial gain.FROM EARLIER: The most advanced malware yet has been spying on you for yearsThe hackers employed the kind of phishing schemes that many Internet users have encountered so far, looking to convince unsuspecting users to click on malicious links that could then allow the hackers to steal sensitive login credentials and gain access to internal documents.But unlike other phishing emails, that are sometimes easy to spot by recipients, the FIN4 emails were more complex, showing that the hackers have ‚Äústrong command of the English language and knowledge of corporate finance and Fortune 500 culture,‚Äù as Ars Technica puts it.After targeting a specific person in a company, and stealing his or her Microsoft Outlook account login details with help of malicious dialog boxes tricking the user to sign in back to his or her account (image above), the hackers would then send other phishing emails to other company insiders, injecting in some of these emails malicious code in Microsoft Office documents.Thus, FIN4 members managed to infect the accounts of C-level executives, legal counsel, scientists and other employees of more than 100 companies, including 80 publicly traded companies and 20 Wall Street companies involved in mergers and acquisitions.It is believed that FIN4 used the intelligence obtained from these spying attacks for financial benefits, though it‚Äôs not clear exactly what FIN4 did with the information it stole.‚ÄúOur visibility into FIN4‚Äôs activities is limited to their network operations,‚Äù FireEye wrote. ‚ÄúWe can only surmise how they may be using and potentially benefiting from the valuable information they are able to obtain. However one fact remains clear: access to insider information that could make or break stock prices for dozens of publicly traded companies could surely put FIN4 at a considerable trading advantage.‚ÄùFIN4 activities, dating as far back as mid 2013, are still on-going, the security firm revealed.

139,8741258,Token-Based Authentication with AngularJS and Node.js,http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/token-based-authentication-with-angularjs-nodejs--cms-22543,2014,"Authentication is one of the most important parts of any web application. In this tutorial, we'll be discussing token-based authentication systems and how they differ from traditional login systems.¬†At the end of this tutorial, you'll see a¬†fully working demo written in AngularJS and NodeJS.You can also find a wide selection¬†of ready-made¬†authentication scripts and apps on Envato Market, such as:Or, if you're struggling with a bug in your AngularJS code, you can submit it¬†to araneux on Envato Studio to have it¬†fixed.Before proceeding with a token-based authentication system, let's have a look at a traditional authentication system first.Everything is fine until this point. The web application works well, and it is able to¬†authenticate users so that they may¬†access restricted endpoints; however, what happens¬†when you want to develop another client, say for¬†Android, for your application? Will you be able to use the current application to authenticate mobile clients and to serve restricted content? As it currently stands, no. There are two main reasons for this:In this case, you need a client-independent application.In token-based authentication, cookies and sessions will not be used. A token will be used for authenticating a¬†user for each request to the¬†server. Let's redesign the¬†first scenario with token-based authentication.It will use the following flow of control:In this case, we have no returned session or cookie, and we have not returned any HTML content. That means that¬†we can use this architecture for any client for a specific application. You can see the architecture schema below:So, what is this JWT?JWT stands for¬†JSON Web Token¬†and¬†is a token format used in authorization headers. This token helps you to design communication¬†between two systems in a secure way. Let's rephrase JWT as the ""bearer¬†token"" for the purposes¬†of this tutorial. A bearer token consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.You can see the JWT schema and an example token below;You do not need to implement the¬†bearer token generator as¬†you can find versions that already exist¬†in several languages. You can see some of them below:After covering some basic information about token-based authentication, we can now proceed with a practical example. Take a look at the following schema, after which we'll analyze it in more detail:Token-based authentication comes with several advantages that solve serious problems. Some of them are as follows:Those are the most common advantages of token-based authentication and communication.¬†That's the end of the theoretical and architectural talk about token-based authentication. Time for a practical example.You will see two applications to¬†demonstrate token-based authentication:In the back-end project, there will be service implementations, and service results will be in JSON format. There is no view returned in services. In the front-end project, there will be an AngularJS project for front-end HTML and then the front-end app will be populated¬†by AngularJS¬†services to make requests to the back-end services.In the back-end project, there are three main files:That's it! This project is very simple, so that you can¬†understand the main concept easily without doing a deep dive.package.json¬†contains dependencies for the project: express¬†for MVC, body-parser¬†for simulating post request handling in NodeJS, morgan¬†for request logging, mongoose for our ORM¬†framework to connect to MongoDB, and¬†jsonwebtoken¬†for creating JWT tokens by using our User model. There is also an attribute called engines¬†that says that this project is made by using NodeJS version >= 0.10.0. This is useful for PaaS services like Heroku. We will also cover that topic in another section.We said that we would generate a token by using the¬†user model payload. This model helps us to make user operations on MongoDB. In User.js, the user-schema is defined and the User model is¬†created by using a mongoose model. This model is ready for database operations.Our dependencies are defined, and our user model is¬†defined, so now let's combine all those to construct a service for handling specific requests.In NodeJS, you can include a module in your project by using require. First, we need to import¬†the necessary modules into the project:Our service will serve through a specific port. If any port variable is defined in the system environment variables, you can use that, or we have defined port 3001. After that, the User model is included, and the database¬†connection is¬†established in order to do some user operations. Do not forget to define an environment variable‚ÄîMONGO_URL‚Äîfor the database connection URL.In the above section, we've made¬†some configurations for simulating an HTTP request handling in NodeJS by using Express. We are allowing requests to come from different domains in order to develop a client-independent system. If you do not allow this, you will trigger a CORS (Cross Origin Request Sharing) error in the¬†web browser.We have imported all of the¬†required modules and defined our¬†configuration, so now it's¬†time to define request handlers. In the above code, whenever you make a POST¬†request to /authenticate¬†with username¬†and password, you will get a JWT¬†token. First, the database¬†query is processed by using a username and password. If a user exists, the user data will be returned with its token. But, what if there is no such user matching the username and/or password?When you make a POST¬†request to /signin with username and¬†password, a new user will be created by using posted user information. On the¬†19th line, you can see that a¬†new JSON token is generated by using the¬†jsonwebtoken¬†module, which has been assigned to the¬†jwt variable. The authentication part is OK. What if we try to access a restricted endpoint? How can we manage to access that endpoint?When you make a¬†GET¬†request to¬†/me, you will get the current user info, but in order to continue with the requested endpoint, the¬†ensureAuthorized function will be executed.In this function, request headers are intercepted and the¬†authorization¬†header is extracted. If a¬†bearer token exists in this header, that token is assigned to¬†req.token¬†in order to be¬†used throughout the¬†request, and the request can be continued by using¬†next(). If a token does not exist, you will get a 403 (Forbidden) response. Let's go back to the¬†handler¬†/me, and use¬†req.token¬†to fetch user data with this token.¬†Whenever you create a¬†new user, a token is generated and saved in the user model in DB. Those tokens are unique.We have only three handlers for this¬†simple project. After that, you will see;The NodeJS¬†app may crash if an error occurs. With the above code, that crash is prevented and an error log is printed in the console. And finally, we can start the server by using the¬†following code snippet.¬†To sum up:We are done with the back-end service. So that it can¬†be used by multiple clients, you can deploy this simple server application to your servers, or maybe you can deploy in Heroku. There is a file called¬†Procfile¬†in the project's root folder. Let's deploy our service in Heroku.You can clone the back-end project from this GitHub repository.I will not be discussing¬†how to create an app in Heroku; you can refer to this article for creating a Heroku app if you have not done this before. After you create your Heroku app, you can add a destination to your current project by using the following command:Now you have cloned a project and added a destination. After¬†git add¬†and¬†git commit,¬†you can push¬†your code to Heroku by performing¬†git push heroku master. When you successfully push a project,¬†Heroku¬†will perform the¬†npm install¬†command to download dependencies¬†into the¬†temp folder on Heroku. After that,¬†it will start your application and¬†you can access your service by using the HTTP protocol.In the front-end project, you will see an AngularJS project. Here, I'll only¬†mention the main sections in the front-end project, because AngularJS is not something that can be covered within a single¬†tutorial.You can clone the project from this GitHub repository.¬†In this project, you will see the following folder structure:ngStorage.js¬†is a library for AngularJS to manipulate local storage operations. Also, there is a main layout¬†index.html¬†and partials that extend the main layout under the¬†partials¬†folder.¬†controllers.js¬†is¬†for defining our controller actions in the¬†front-end.¬†services.js¬†is¬†for¬†making service¬†requests to our service that I mentioned in the previous project. We have a bootstrap-like file called¬†app.js¬†and in this file, configurations and¬†module imports are applied. Finally,¬†client.js¬†is for serving static HTML files (or just¬†index.html, in this¬†case); this helps us to serve static HTML files when you deploy to a server without using Apache or any other web servers.In the main layout HTML file, all of the required JavaScript files are included for AngularJS-related libraries, as well as¬†our custom controller, service, and app file.In the above code, the¬†HomeCtrl¬†controller is defined and some required modules are¬†injected like¬†$rootScope¬†and¬†$scope. Dependency injection is one of the strongest properties of AngularJS.¬†$scope¬†is the bridge variable between controllers and views in AngularJS that means¬†you can use¬†test¬†in view if you defined it in a specified controller like¬†$scope.test=....¬†In this¬†controller, some utility functions are defined, such as:In the main layout, in the main menu list, you can see the¬†data-ng-controller¬†attribute with a value¬†HomeCtrl. That means that¬†this menu dom element¬†can¬†share scope with¬†HomeCtrl. When you click the sign-up button in the form, the sign-up function in the controller file will be executed, and in this function, the sign-up service is used from the Main service that is¬†already injected in this controller.¬†The main structure is¬†view -> controller -> service. This service makes simple Ajax requests to the back-end in order to get specific data.In the above code, you can see service functions like making requests for authenticating. In controller.js, you may have already realised that there are functions like¬†Main.me. This¬†Main¬†service¬†has been injected in the controller, and in the controller, the services belonging to this service are called directly.¬†These¬†functions are simply Ajax requests to our service which we deployed together. Do not forget to put the service URL in¬†baseUrl¬†in the above code. When you deploy your service to Heroku, you will get a service URL like¬†appname.herokuapp.com. In the above code, you¬†will set¬†var baseUrl = ""appname.herokuapp.com"".¬†In the¬†sign-up or sign-in part of the application, the bearer token responds to the¬†request and this token is saved to local storage. Whenever you make a request to a service in the back-end, you need to put this token in the headers. You can do this by using AngularJS interceptors.In the above code, every request is intercepted and an authorization header and value are put¬†in the headers.In the front-end project, we have some partial pages like¬†signin,¬†signup,¬†profile¬†details, and¬†vb. These partial¬†pages are related with specific controllers. You can see that relation in¬†app.js:As you can easily understand in the above code, when you go to /, the¬†home.html¬†page will be rendered.¬†Another example: if you go to¬†/signup,¬†signup.html¬†will be rendered. This¬†rendering¬†operation will be done in the browser, not on the server-side.You can see how everything we discussed in this tutorial works into practice¬†by checking out this¬†working demo.Token-based authentication systems help you to construct an authentication/authorization system¬†while you are developing client-independent¬†services. By using this technology, you will just focus on your services (or APIs).¬†The authentication/authorization part will be handled by the token-based authentication system as a layer in front of your services. You can access and use services from any client like web browsers, Android, iOS, or a desktop client.And if you're looking for ready-made solutions, check out the¬†authentication scripts and apps¬†on Envato Market.Envato Tuts+ tutorials are translated into other languages by our community members‚Äîyou can be involved too!"

141,7817053,TrueCrypt turmoil latest: Bruce Schneier reveals what he'll use instead,http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/29/truecrypt_analysis/,2014,"The TrueCrypt project abruptly imploded on Wednesday ‚Äì leaving folks in the infosec world scratching heads and scrambling to recommend alternatives.In the past hour, crypto-guru Bruce Schneier has told us he's switched back to Symantec's PGPDisk to encrypt his data.""I have no idea what's going on with TrueCrypt,"" he added on his blog. ""Speculations include a massive hack of the TrueCrypt developers, some Lavabit-like forced shutdown, and an internal power struggle within TrueCrypt. I suppose we'll have to wait and see what develops.""As The Register reported, visitors to the ‚Ä™official truecrypt.org‚Ä¨ website were redirected to a SourceForge-hosted site, which warned the popular multi-platform disk-encryption software is insecure:This page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt.The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images. Such integrated support is also available on other platforms (click here for more information). You should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.The above message is included in the developer-signed executables of a new version of TrueCrypt, released this week and available now from the SourceForge site; version 7.2 pops up an alert during installation urging the user to migrate files away from the easy-to-use tool:This new build has been nobbled to prevent further encryption of data. It should not be relied upon to safeguard sensitive information. The previous version, 7.1a, was released in 2012.At first, the truecrypt.org switcheroo appeared to be an act of web vandalism by miscreants who had compromised the super-secretive TrueCrypt development team.But the inclusion of the above warning in the cryptographically-signed binaries strongly suggests that the message did really come from the anonymous developers of TrueCrypt ‚Äì or whoever is in possession of its private key.Matthew Green, a computer-science professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, US, commented: ""I think it's unlikely that an unknown hacker identified the Truecrypt developers, stole their signing key, and hacked their site.""Prof Green and Kenn White, a cloud security expert and engineer, are spearheading an effort to audit the source code of TrueCrypt 7.1a, which is available to download and build. Last month the software successfully cleared the first phase of an independent code-quality inspection, which ‚Äúfound no evidence of backdoors or intentional flaws‚Äù. A grassroots campaign raised $70,000 to pay for the professional audit, funds that the latest developments would suggest may have been wasted. An unrelated announcement on the audit project's progress was due to be made today.""Our board is meeting this morning, and should have announcement mid-day on our plans. I think the community will be happy with the direction we're going,"" White told The Register."

They credited Monsegur with helping them cripple Anonymous, the notorious crew of hacktivists who stole confidential information, defaced Web sites and temporarily put some victims out of business.Working around the clock with FBI agents at his side, Monsegur ‚Äúprovided, in real time, information about then-ongoing computer hacks and vulnerabilities in significant computer systems,‚Äù prosecutors wrote. The FBI estimates that he helped detect at least 300 hacks, preventing millions of dollars in losses, they added.After his arrest and guilty plea in 2011, Monsegur faced more than two decades behind bars. But because of his cooperation, the sentence could be two years or less. Monsegur‚Äôs whereabouts aren‚Äôt publicly known. One of his attorneys declined to comment Monday.‚Äî Associated PressThe price of oil slipped to near $104 a barrel Monday after preliminary results showed a billionaire businessman winning a clear majority in Ukraine‚Äôs presidential elections.By mid-afternoon in Europe, benchmark crude for July delivery was down 27 cents, to $104.08 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Friday, the Nymex contract rose 61 cents, to settle at $104.35, bringing its weekly gain to $2.33.Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, was down 60¬†cents, to $109.94, on the ICE Futures exchange in London.Candy tycoon Petro Poro¬≠shenko, who supports close ties with Europe but also wants to mend relations with Russia, was leading the Ukrainian elections with about 54 percent of the votes when 75 percent of the precincts were counted Monday. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was second with 13 percent. If those results hold, Poro¬≠shenko would avoid a runoff election next month.Oil prices have been underpinned by the threat of expanded Western sanctions over Russia‚Äôs role in the crisis in Ukraine, which is a key conduit for Russian gas deliveries to Europe. Although Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his country would respect the outcome of the vote, there was still uncertainty.Poroshenko‚Äôs victory ‚Äúis being interpreted as a sign of the conflict easing, prompting some market participants to take profits,‚Äù said analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ‚ÄúThe ongoing lack of stability in eastern Ukraine and the continuing production outages in Libya are likely to preclude any sharper fall in prices,‚Äù Commerzbank concluded.Trading in energy futures was thinner than usual as markets were closed Monday in the United States and Britain.‚Äî Associated PressVenezuela has reached deals with six airlines to pay for debts accumulated in 2012 and 2013, Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco Torres said Monday in a post on his Twitter account.The South American country will pay Colombia‚Äôs Avianca Holdings SA for debt accumulated by its Avianca and Taca airlines in 2012, he said. An agreement also has been reached with Grupo Aeromexico SAB de CV, Curacao‚Äôs Insel Air, Ecuador‚Äôs Tame and Aruba Airlines for debt accumulated in 2013, Torres said.Airlines had an equivalent of $3.9 billion stuck in bolivars as of April, according to the International Air Transport Association. The sales in bolivars can‚Äôt be exchanged into dollars for repatriation because of a decade-long system of currency controls. The airline association said currency restrictions have prompted at least 11 carriers to cut capacity, sales or routes to South America‚Äôs largest oil exporter in the past year.‚Äî Bloomberg NewsIndia‚Äôs current-account deficit narrowed to a new four-year low as higher tariffs reduced gold imports, giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government more room to bolster Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy.The shortfall was $1.2 billion in January through March, compared with $4.2 billion for the prior quarter, the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement in Mumbai. The deficit was equivalent to 0.2 percent of gross domestic product for the quarter, while the gap for the fiscal year shrank to 1.7 percent from 4.7¬†percent in the previous 12 months. A shrinking shortfall will bolster India‚Äôs rupee, which has rebounded from a record low on optimism about Modi, who was sworn in Monday.‚Äî Bloomberg News           businesseconomytruePlease provide a valid email address.

143,7783734,Cuba blocks Yoani Sanchez's dissident newspaper,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27511211,2014,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Cuban government has blocked an online newspaper launched by well-known dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez, hours after it went live.Web users in Cuba are being diverted to another website, which accuses Ms Sanchez of having hidden political interests. Ms Sanchez said her website, called 14ymedio, would provide daily news about the communist-run country.She insisted it would not be a platform against the government.But web users in Cuba reported that they were being diverted to a website calling itself ""yoani$landia"", which accuses Ms Sanchez of being ""obsessed with money"".""This website is from a group of people who had enough of seeing Yoani Sanchez presenting herself as the Mother Teresa of Calcutta of Cuban dissidents,"" says an article on the site.It adds that Ms Sanchez is ""probably the richest Cuban on the island"" and is funded by Spanish and Brazilian media outfits.The editors of yoani$landia do not identify themselves, but they are believed to be Cuban government officials.Cuban media, including the country's three national newspapers, are under strict state control. But President Raul Castro has eased restrictions on dissidents in recent years, allowing opponents of the government - including Sanchez - to travel abroad. In her blog published in the online paper's first edition, Sanchez says 14ymedio has been an obsession for her for more than four years.She says she wants the paper to ""contribute information so that Cubans can decide with more maturity their own destinies"". Its first edition also features a report from a Havana hospital, describing the work of nurses and other staff on night duty and the victims of violence they attend to.It also showcases a lengthy interview with jailed opposition writer Angel Santiesteban.But not all its contents is of a political nature. There is also advice on how to deal with dry or damaged hair and a sports feature on why Cuban football is getting less coverage and state backing than baseball. Sanchez achieved international recognition with her prize-winning blog Generation Y, in which she criticised the restrictions on freedom of speech and movement imposed on the island since the 1959 revolution.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesThe UN humanitarian chief pleads for help to avoid ""a catastrophe"" in four African countries.

SpyStudio shows the differences in the registry and file system operations, COM object and Windows creations, and the rest of the events (see more).To troubleshoot a virtual application you can compare the virtual application's trace with the base trace. Using this feature, you can see what is generating the issue (see more).Nektra‚Äôs SpyStudio simplifies application virtualization packaging for VMware ThinApp and Symantec Workspace Virtualization. It includes advanced features for application harvesting, and troubleshooting. It is able to package applications with or without installation media in ThinApp environment (see more).SpyStudio is the user-mode Procmon complement. Looking for application errors with kernel-mode traces is tedious, and it is very difficult to see the final outcome of a user-mode call. With kernel-mode tools, you get a lot of noise that the application does not see, since a single user-mode call generates lots of kernel-mode events that are not important from the application's perspective. Most application errors are generated by failed user-mode calls which expect a different state of some resources: registry keys and values, files, pipes, services and printers.SpyStudio is also able to read Process Monitor logs¬†(see¬†Load ProcMon log) and show them in a user friendly interface. It shows registry operations in tree form like Regedit and displays errors in red. File operations are also displayed in tree form.SpyStudio can now troubleshoot .NET applications: it logs exceptions, assembly loads, object creation and much more.SpyStudio is also being used in other IT sectors such as the cybersecurity field. The books Malware Forensics: Investigating and Analyzing Malicious Code and Malware Forensics Field Guide for Windows Systems discuss one way SpyStudio can be used to fight malware."
145,10098233,Microsoft in 2018,http://seekingalpha.com/article/3458066-microsoft-in-2018,2015,"Microsoft started the hardware shift with the Surface; new Windows 10 smartphones are the next step.Microsoft Office has always been a cash cow, and Office 365 seems poised to take this to the next level.A cloudy future is a good thing for Microsoft investors.It's the year 2018, and it has been an interesting last few years for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Three years ago, the company's business was beginning to change, with roughly 60% of its revenue generated by the Commercial division. On the Devices and Consumer side, Microsoft's Surface, XBox, and Office 365, businesses were the star performers. In 2018, things have become very different. Microsoft's cloud business is the main driver of revenue, as its Commercial business now represents more than 70% of the company's total. There have been some challenges along the way, but overall investors are pretty happy with the end result.It started With The Surface tabletIn 2015, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO made the difficult decision to take a huge write down of its Nokia investment. In addition, he essentially said the company's current smartphones weren't good enough. Specifically, he said the company would, ""generate new growth‚Ä¶on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio.""Many investors read in between the lines, and realized this meant the company would release its own smartphones for Windows 10. A few years before, Microsoft surprised many with the first Surface tablet. Investors were skeptical that the software company could compete with the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, and the slew of tablets running Google's ((NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) Android OS.Though the Surface RT was a huge misstep, once the Surface 3 came out, the tide began to shift. In 2015, Google was focused on YouTube, and its search business. With YouTube viewership rising by 60% year over year, and paid clicks up 18% in the middle of the year, Google was keeping its investors happy. Apple sold over $4 billion worth of iPads, but with revenue and units down on an annual basis, the focus was on the iPhone and the Apple Watch.In 2016, Microsoft introduced the first Surface smartphone. Knowing that it had to compete with the likes of the iPhone 6S and the Google Nexus 6X, Microsoft went big. The first Surface phone had a 5.5"" Ultra HD display, a quad-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 or 128 GB of storage.This was a watershed moment, as developers finally could get on the Windows app bandwagon. In 2018, the app store for Windows sits at over 750,000. The gap between the three big ecosystems has finally begun to close. With only about 8% of the global smartphone market, Microsoft has a long way to go. However, keep in mind Windows had less than 3% market share in 2015.Some Things Never ChangeOne thing that hasn't really changed in 2018 is the fact that consumers and businesses use Microsoft Office as their productivity suite. In 2015, Office 365 was beginning to gain significant traction, as consumer Office subscribers topped 15 million. On the commercial side, Office 365 was slowed by the Windows 10 launch, but once businesses realized that Windows 10 was a solid upgrade, Office 365 commercial grew by leaps and bounds.Three changes in the last few years have really solidified Microsoft's hold on the productivity business. First, in 2017 Apple decided to shutter its productivity suite. Though hard core Apple fans loved Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, these software products no longer fit Apple's hardware core business.Second, in late 2017 Google decided a free productivity suite no longer made sense. The company was making so much money on its self-driving car technology, and from YouTube subscriptions, that giving away Google Docs was no longer good business.Third, by 2017 Microsoft finally managed to fully integrate Cortana and Skype into Office 365. With voice commands through Cortana to accomplish simple tasks, and Skype for real-time collaboration, Office 365 has become an even bigger cash cow for Microsoft than before. Investors love the stability of the company's subscription revenue model, and constant updates and new features keep users happy.The Future Is Cloudy, And That's A Good ThingMicrosoft's biggest transformation has been the growth of its commercial cloud business. In 2015, the company generated about $8 billion in annual cloud revenue. Somewhat surprisingly, by 2018, Microsoft surpassed its goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud revenue.The company's deep knowledge of CRM has helped its Dynamics CRM Ultra business to explode. In 2015, CRM was a $20 billion market and Microsoft had only a small part of the pie. Today, CRM is a $35 billion market, and Microsoft owns 20%. Microsoft's reputation in the cloud computing space has helped Azure become a monster business for the company.In fact, between Office 365 Commercial, Dynamics CRM Ultra, and Azure, Microsoft posted an annual run rate of $20.6 billion in commercial cloud revenue based on the second quarter of 2018.Final ThoughtsIt hasn't all been roses for Microsoft on the path to 2018. Windows 11 wasn't that well received, but Windows 12 seems to be a strong upgrade. When the second iteration of Surface smartphones came out, the Surface X was compared to the Zune media player. When Apple released the Apple Watch 4, with a screen that expanded to 4"", but could be folded to wear on the wrist, all of the smartphone industry shuddered. When Apple announced the price would be $999, some of these fears were lessened.That being said, Microsoft's Office 365 is now the undisputed leader in the industry. The company's commercial solutions are well regarded, and Microsoft's Commercial revenue growth of $17 billion in the last three years is remarkable. This significant revenue growth, combined with impressive margins, has led the company to earnings per share of nearly $4.As investors have realized Microsoft has become a growth story again, the P/E multiple has expanded to about 20. With the stock above $80 a share, investors who bought in 2015 are up more than 75%. This company once thought to be dead money, has turned into a market darling once again.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

146,9216380,Japan Demoes Wireless Power Transmission for Space-Based Solar Farms,http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/solar/japan-demoes-wireless-power-transmission-for-spacebased-solar-farms,2015,"With a few exceptions, sources of renewable energy tend to be inconveniently unreliable. Things like wind and wave energy are subject to the whims of weather, and even if you manage to find something that isn‚Äôt weather dependent (like tidal flow), you still can‚Äôt rely on a constant output of power. Strictly speaking, solar power is the worst:¬†it's heavily weather dependent, and half the time, it doesn't work at all. (Even the moon gets in the way sometimes.)Some think the way to make solar power the backbone of a renewable energy economy is to avoid the problematic Earth entirely and head out into space, where the sun is always shining¬†and weather means something entirely different.¬†Solar power satellites¬†(SPS) are more than a concept: it‚Äôs an area of active research and development, led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). JAXA explained its¬†25 year technology development roadmap that culminates in a 1 gigawatt SPS sending solar power back to Earth¬†in the 2030s¬†in IEEE Spectrum¬†last year. Last week, JAXA and Mitsubishi demonstrated their progress on one of the most difficult components of that system: long range wireless power transmission.Space-based solar power on a commercially viable scale will be an enormous undertaking. For an output of 1 gigawatt, Japan is planning on deploying a solar collector weighing over 10,000 metric tons and¬†measuring several kilometers across. It would live in geosynchronous orbit, some 36,000 kilometers from Earth.Arguably, the most difficult part of this whole business (from a technological perspective) is getting the power from the satellite back down to Earth where we can actually use it, and until we can find a long enough extension cord, there's only one way to make it work: wirelessly.The only efficient ways to transmit power wirelessly over a very long distance, according to JAXA researchers, is with either lasers or microwaves. Lasers¬†are impractical because they‚Äôd run into the same problems that solar power does on Earth: they don't work through clouds. Microwaves, though, work even if the weather is bad, so they're what JAXA has been planning on using to transmit power.On Thursday, JAXA was able to deliver 1.8 kilowatts ‚Äúwith pinpoint accuracy‚Äù to a receiving antenna (rectenna) 55 meters away using carefully directed¬†microwaves. According to JAXA, this is the first time that anyone‚Äôs been able to send such a high power output with this level of direction control.¬†Also on Thursday, Mitsubishi (in partnership with JAXA) managed to send 10 kilowatts of power over a distance of 500 meters, using larger antennas with more of an emphasis on power over precision.The obvious question here is one of efficiency: being able to transmit power is great, but if you lose most of it along the way, will the overall system ever reach commercial viability? At this point, the conversion system (solar to DC to microwave to DC to AC) is about 80 percent¬†efficient, but¬†that excludes loss of energy in transit.¬†Neither JAXA nor Mitsubishi are commenting on the efficiency of these specific¬†tests (which, to be fair, weren't‚Äôt¬†optimized for efficiency), but we do know that as of last year, JAXA expected¬†a 1.6 kilowatt microwave¬†beam to yield a rectenna output of about 350 watts¬†from a 50 meter test.¬†Within the next five years or so,¬†Mitsubishi is hoping that they‚Äôll be able to use this system for short range high power delivery (like electric car charging),¬†and medium range delivery of small amounts of power (like powering warning lights on transmission towers). Meanwhile, JAXA is planning on testing the technology in space by 2018, with a small satellite transmitting several kilowatts from low Earth orbit to a microwave receiver on the ground. JAXA hopes to have a 100 kW satellite in orbit by 2021, and a¬†200 MW version by 2028. By 2031, if everything goes well, a 1 gigawatt commercial¬†pilot plant will be in operation, with a full on commercial space-based power industry to kick off with one launch per year starting in 2037.IEEE Spectrum‚Äôs energy, power, and green tech blog, featuring news and analysis about the future of energy, climate, and the smart grid.Sign up for the EnergyWise newsletter and get biweekly news on the power & energy industry, green technology, and conservation delivered directly to your inbox.Solar DC microgrids could do for electrification what mobile phones did for telephony

Well, according to the latest RedMonk
Programming Language¬†Rankings ‚Äì introduced by
the ‚ÄòMonks as a substitute for the now defunct GitHub leagues ‚Äì
it‚Äôs Java and JavaScript, which usually do-si-do between respective
first and second spots. By the way, in case you had the same
knee-jerk gasp of indignation as us, Java and JavaScript are
tied in the top spot, not lumped together as
one.Now that‚Äôs cleared up, let‚Äôs take a closer look
at the top ten. Since the 
first of RedMonk‚Äôs biannual reports for
2014, there‚Äôs been little change among the major players, with the
following languages taking the premier positions :1. Java / JavaScript3. PHP4. Python5. C #6. C + / Ruby8. CSS9. C10. Objective-CThere was a little more activity in the ‚Äòteens‚Äô
spots, as we can see, with Perl dropping down two places from
January, and Clojure and 
Groovy¬†drawing even¬†at number
19:11. Shell12. ¬†Perl13. R14. Scale15. Haskell16. Matlab17. Visual Basic18. CoffeeScript19. Clojure / GroovyAs ever, it‚Äôs worth taking these rankings with a pinch
of salt. It‚Äôs not possible to decipher how representative of the
market as a whole RedMonk‚Äôs data truly is, and how qualitative
conclusions about issues like ‚Äúoutlook‚Äù or ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù can be
drawn on this basis. For a fuller picture, it may well be worth
taking into account other rankings, such as the 
TIOBE Index, which lists the top twenty as thus:1. ¬† C2. ¬† Java3. ¬† Objective-C4. ¬† C + +5. ¬† C #6. ¬† (Visual) Basic7. ¬† PHP8. ¬† Python9. ¬† JavaScript10. Visual Basic. NET11. Transact-SQL12. ¬†Perl13. ¬†Ruby14. ¬†ActionScript15. ¬†F #16. ¬†Lisp17. ¬†Delphi / Object Pascal18. Pascal19. ¬†MATLAB20. ¬†AssemblyOverall, RedMonk report a little more movement
than is typical, but overall, results have been fairly consistent.
One interesting trend outside any spectacular leaps in language
popularity has been the widening correlation gap between GitHub and
Stack Overflow rankings. As the analysts note, whilst this isn‚Äôt
news per se, should this continental drift in programming language
traction continue, it would certainly warrant further
investigation.Other points of interest include the continued rise of Go,
which now sits on the cusp of top twenty rankings at number 21 in
the index. With the steady increase in projects moving onto
Google‚Äôs pet language from other alternatives, we could see it make
this jump within the next six to twelve months.Lucy Carey

new release of Dart has brought significant performance
improvements to generated JavaScript and enhanced functionality on
the server side.Now at version 1.1, the open-source ‚ÄúJavaScript killer‚Äù was
created by a team at Google that includes Lars Bak, the mind behind
the speedy V8 JavaScript engine used in Chrome and Node.js. Since
the release of a production-ready 
Dart 1.0 last November appeared to fail to excite the public at
large, the race is on to convince developers of its appeal.One of the biggest marketing bullet points for Dart has been its
speed, but this has historically only been true within the
custom-built Dart VM. Performance of the Dart VM began to overtake
V8 in September 2012, and has remained in the lead ever since.Yet this is hardly representative of the way most Dart is
presumably being deployed, which is as JavaScript compiled via
Dart2JS ‚Äì not dissimilar to the way CoffeeScript works. It‚Äôs only
in recent months that the Dart2JS compiler has begun to outshine
hand-written JavaScript.Of the four key
benchmarks being tracked by the Dart team, the Dart-generated
JavaScript is considerably faster in the ‚ÄòTracer‚Äô test, and
JavaScript and Dart2JS are currently neck-and-neck in
‚ÄòFluidMotion‚Äô. On ‚ÄòRichards‚Äô, too, Dart2JS is 94% as fast as
JavaScript.It remains to be seen if such increases are enough to lure users
of vanilla JavaScript or existing preprocessing language users. The
truth is, though, that this doesn‚Äôt matter: Dart is designed for
teams building Google-sized front-end projects, and could become
popular within this niche without being widely adopted.In addition, like JavaScript on Node.js, Dart may find a
parallel life on the server with the dart:io library. The
Dart team has been enhancing the language‚Äôs server-side features,
which as of v1.1 now includes support for large files, file
copying, process signal handlers, terminal information and UDP.The most powerful way to push Dart adoption would obviously be
to integrate its VM into the mainline Chrome browser, but there‚Äôs
still no word of this happening. It seems the Dart team still have
their work cut out in bringing the rest of their colleagues up to
speed on their wunderkind.Photo by Emilio blue.Elliot Bentley

Remember Project: C.H.I.P. ? 



A $9 Linux-based, super-cheap computer that raised some $2 Million beyond a pledge goal of just $50,000 on Kickstarter will be soon in your pockets.



Four months ago, Dave Rauchwerk, CEO of Next Thing Co., utilized the global crowd-funding corporation ‚ÄòKickstarter‚Äô for backing his project C.H.I.P., a fully functioning computer that offers more than what you could expect for just $9.



C.H.I.P. stands for ""Computer Hardware in Products.""



At first, the project was looking like a never ending project but here's something exciting ‚Äî The $9 CHIP computer is shipping.



Yes, Rauchwerk says that the first run of devices is beginning to be distributed to early backers within 7-9 days.


Rauchwerk said, ""If you backed the [CHIP] project at the Kernel Hacker Backer level on Kickstarter, you'll receive two CHIP computers ‚Äî the second by mid-October.""



Specifications and Capabilities:






CHIP packages:

1GHz R8 ARM processor
4GB of internal flash storage
512MB of DDR3 RAM
Bluetooth
Wi-Fi connection


Looking at the output front of it, CHIP features:

A single full-sized USB port
Microphone input
Headphones output
A composite video output that supports older televisions
A micro USB that supports OTG


As it is an open source project, CHIP offers support for thousands of open source applications such as:

LibreOffice package for editing documents and spreadsheets
Chromium for browsing the Web
VLC Media Player for playing audios as well as videos
Other programs for coding, torrenting, and photo editing, among others


Also, the researchers are calling it as Alpha C.H.I.P.s with initial build root as Ubuntu. They did not stress upon the innovation of the alpha CHIP itself, instead offer a complete How to get started with CHIP that you can follow here.

The answers to the crossword are chosen from the 1000 most used passwords for Adobe user accounts from the recent password leak.   The clues are up to 50 of the most commonly used hints for each of the passwords.Partly because I had a look at the password dump and found it surprisingly fun to try and guess people's passwords; partly to highlight how insecure most common memorable passwords are and how little you should trust that corporations, such as Adobe, are following best practice when it comes to storing them.Not any more.  The passwords in these crosswords will have already been guessed long ago by people who have far more time and computing power to put towards it.
					For example Facebook is putting efforts towards finding Adobe passwords to protect their users, and Facebook has a lot more power at their disposal in terms of minds and computers than I do.Then you A: have a bad password; and B: should change your password as soon as you can anywhere else you may have used it.
					The current best practice for passwords is to generate a unique random password for every login and use a password management service such as KeePass, RoboForm, or LastPass.I originally got the idea from xkcd #1286: Encryptic, and the technique he uses there can indeed be used to work out some of the harder clues, however most of the ones used here are pretty easy to guess without looking at the tail end of the hash.I don't.  However I am fairly confident of most of them.  The top 100 are taken directly from the Stricture Group top 100 adobe passwords; the rest are guessed based on the clues.  If you do think I've got something incorrect then please let me know which you believe to be wrong, and why.I've only used the 1000 most common passwords in this, of those I guessed 65%, spending less than 10 seconds on each, the remaining ones were mostly people's names or non-English words.  If someone wants to give me a more complete list of answers then I will gladly generate some more crosswords."

The new model, an exciting and sensuous drophead, will be known as Rolls-Royce Dawn.The car was unveiled to representatives of the marque‚Äôs 130-strong global dealer network at the 2015 Rolls-Royce World Dealer Conference in Los Angeles, California today.‚ÄúOur new Rolls-Royce Dawn promises a striking, seductive encounter like no other Rolls-Royce to date‚Ä¶ Dawn is a beautiful new open-top motor car with a name that suggests the fresh opportunities that every new day holds ‚Äì an awakening, an opening up of one‚Äôs senses and a burst of sunshine. It will be the most social of super-luxury motor cars for those beautiful people who wish to bathe in the sunlight of the world‚Äôs social hotspots.‚Äù said Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, Chief Executive Officer.Rolls-Royce Dawn is the next step in the renaissance of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars which began in 2003 with the launch of Phantom and subsequent introductions of Ghost and Wraith. It justifies the continuing investment of the BMW Group into the world‚Äôs pinnacle super-luxury brand.The new Rolls-Royce Dawn will revive another famous and rare Rolls-Royce name first used in 1949, but only ever applied to 28 very special drophead bodies between 1950 and 1954. A new beginning for Rolls-Royce at the time, the original Silver Dawn was the first Rolls-Royce to be offered with a factory-built body.The drophead Rolls-Royces that carried the name Dawn continued to be coach-built for individual customers, ensuring their uniqueness and rarity.‚ÄòDawn‚Äô perfectly expresses the character of the new Rolls-Royce. In its tentative, inchoate, anticipatory state, dawn is the world coming to light from the ethereal dark of the night. The early-day chill of dawn provides an erotic tingle on the skin, awakening the senses and passions as the day begins.Like¬†Eleanor¬†Thornton, thought by many to be the inspiration behind the Spirit of Ecstasy, the Rolls-Royce Dawn will also prove itself to be the muse that leads its owner to believe that at the start of the day, anything is possible.The new Rolls-Royce Dawn is beguilingly visceral. It excites both men and women ‚Äì they want it, they need it and they want to immerse themselves in it. It is languid and beautiful, fresh and fragrant and awakens the passion of your life. New life, new possibilities, fresh horizons ‚Äì a tingling, anticipatory ambience in the air ‚Äì all signified by a new Dawn.Rolls-Royce Dawn is the fourth new model since BMW took over the super-luxury brand in 2003. When it goes on sale in early 2016, it will join the Phantom, Ghost and Wraith.Rolls-Royce Dawn will launch during the first quarter of 2016."

I will no longer be posting on this blog.Thank you.According to reports, the sister of the President of Nigeria, Nancy Jonathan-Olei, passed away today after a brief illness.She passed away in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, at the age of 52.Enugu Catholic priest and founder of the Adoration Ministry, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, yesterday raised an alarm that he has been receiving threat messages following his New Year eve message where he said that Nigeria would be doomed if President Goodluck Jonathan is re-elected. However, the priest says he is not afraid of death.In a sermon at the Christ the King Catholic Parish GRA, Enugu, yesterday, Rev. Mbaka said if such threats could move him, he would not even be standing before the congregation that morning.""Tell them I am not afraid of them. I have said what I was asked to say. The only word I have for them is Isaiah 54:15,17: 'Surely they shall gather, but because the gathering is not of God they shall scatter. No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper.',"""" he said.""They said Buhari gave me money, but I have never met with Buhari. I don't know him in person. I only delivered the message I was given and I stand by that message because the future of this country is bleak with Jonathan on the saddle.""Accordingto Mbaka, he had called Mrs. Patience Jonathan severally before he gave the December 31, 2014 message but couldn't get through to her.""When she came here, I told her to give me her number so that I could give her messages, but thrice she refused. It was later she told one of the pastors with her to give me his number,"" he stated.""So, before that message, I had called the number for two weeks but it was always the Personal Assistant to the pastor that picked the calls.""Mbaka re-affirmed yesterday that if Jonathan is re-elected, ""the next four years will be hell for the country. People are crying of hanger but then you will see what is hunger.""A vehicle transporting troops of the Nigerien contingent of the UN Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), on Sunday drove on a landmine in the northern region of Gao, leaving six soldiers injured in the explosion, three of them critically, a UN source has announced.The incident occurred on the road between Ansongo and Menaka, MINUSMA said, renewing its call to all stakeholders in the peace process already underway to be proactive in preventing attacks on UN peacekeepers.According to corroborating details from various sources, Northern Mali, especially the Gao and Timbuktu regions have for the past ten days been mired in a wave of violence including kidnappings, attacks and fighting between armed factions.These incidents take place a few days ahead of a crucial round of peace talks between the government in Bamako and the armed movements, which have moved to distinguish themselves from terrorist organizations and criminals.This last phase of the negotiations to be held in January should in principle lead to the signing of a pre-agreement ahead of a final peace deal, the signing of which is slated to take place in the Malian capital Bamako.- Star Africa NewsSuspected men of the Islamist sect, Boko Haram have seized a military base in the Nigerian town of Baga.

160,8473415,APPLE PAY: Now OR Never FOR MOBILE PAYMENTS?,http://www.mutualmobile.com/posts/apple-pay-now-never-mobile-payments,2014,"
Since 2010 it has been rumored that Apple would include Near Field Communication technology in the iPhone in order to support an integrated mobile payments experience for customers, but year after year Apple ignored the emergence of the NFC contact-less payment market, and seemed content to move forward with payment solutions enabled by Bluetooth Low Energy. So why now, in 2014, is Apple breaking its silence on NFC, and will Apple Pay finally push NFC contact-less payments into the mainstream?

The US credit card processing system is extremely outdated, and in desperate need of a security and user experience upgrade. In the last year, the US has experienced major credit card security breaches in two of the biggest retailers in the US, Target and Home Depot, leading to millions upon millions of fraudulent charges. For Apple Pay, Apple has worked with the payment processing networks to create end-to-end security for the user leveraging the EMVCo specification, completely removing the actual credit card number from any part of the payment process and instead generating one time payment tokens that are useless after they are processed. Simply put, the Target and Home Depot breaches would not have even been possible with Apple Pay. Tom Noyes, a former credit card executive, goes so far as saying that Apple Pay is ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the most secure payments scheme on the planet.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs secure.

All the security in the world won‚Äôt make consumers adopt mobile payments schemes. The mainstream consumer is interested in ease of use, not security. Theatrical infomercial-style examples aside, Apple has created an experience where the amount of ‚Äúeffort‚Äù the user has to exert is pull their phone out of their pocket/purse, hold it up to a contactless payment terminal, hold their finger on TouchID (biometric security!), and wait for the vibration. The user doesn‚Äôt have to wake their phone, find an app, or even look at their phone ‚Äì now that is a win for the user. For some people, digging through a purse or freeing up a hand to pull a phone out of pocket could be called too much effort, or at least too similar to the current transaction experience. But Apple Watch looks to even remove that. For an Apple Watch user, a simple wave of their wrist in front of the terminal, and they have made the most secure type of payment possible in the world today. 

While other payment players have inserted themselves directly into the payment chain, Apple has built a system in which they have completely removed themselves from the actual details of the transaction. Apple will not track what you bought, where you bought it, or how much you paid. It will be impossible for Apple to build a profile of you and where you spend your money. The transaction will be between the consumer, merchant, and bank. 

At the end of the day, mobile payments will only be successful if physical brick-and-mortar stores accept contactless payments. Until there is mass adoption, mobile payments is doomed to fail with the mainstream consumer audience. The above control Apple gives retailers is certainly nice motivation, but the real push comes from a looming liability shift set for October 2015. EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) is a globally recognized, secure payments standard, but it has seen limited adoption in the US, which has forced payment processors to draw a line in the sand. If a counterfeit transaction takes place today, the payment processing network eats the majority of that cost. After the liability shift, if a customer holds an EMV compliant credit card, but the merchant is unable to process it as such due to not having supported hardware, the merchant will be responsible for that fraudulent charge. Which means that merchants now will have skin in the game to actually upgrade their payment processing hardware. 

Retailers have historically balked at the cost to upgrade their POS equipment, and rightfully so. In the US, there hasn‚Äôt been a clear winner in how transactions will happen in the future, and no one wants to upgrade to equipment for the losing standard. Apple entering the game gives NFC the boost it needs, and will give retailers the confidence to upgrade their POS systems to ones that support both EMV and NFC. 

Apple Pay is hitting the market at the perfect time ‚Äì security concerns are reaching a fever pitch, consumer interest is at its peak, and retailers are finally paying attention. But Apple Pay shouldn‚Äôt be reduced to simply the right player at the right time. The work they have done around biometric security and TouchID is essential to success here and to date. Apple has made an incredibly clean and calculated solution; and with that, 2015 might actually be the year mobile payments go mainstream.

Description.This add-on adds a customizable presence to your browser window's statusbar that gives you up-to-date information on your browser's cache usage, both RAM and the hard drive. The presence also has a right-click context menu, where you can easily clear your browser's cache. It can also automatically clean your cache when it reaches a specified level, through its Options. Features- An icon sits on your address-bar and tells you the current cache status of your browser.    - If the extension takes too much space of your address-bar, use the settings to switch to the compact mode.     - It is possible to manually refresh cache status at any-time form right-click context menu.     - This extension works with Firefox 1.5 to 29.0 (latest)     - Besides showing the cache usage, the extension lets you manually clear RAM, Disk or All caches. FAQ.[1] What is cache?    In computing, a cache is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache (cache hit), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise (cache miss), the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the greater the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the overall system performance becomes.     [2] Is it possible to move the UI to statusbar of Firefox?    Yes, if you don't like the new addressbar look in version 0.8.1, install version 0.8.3 from:     https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cache-status/versions/ The icon will appear in the statusbar if it is available (restart required).     [3] How to install Cache Status extension in your Firefox?    To install this extension, head to Mozilla Store and click on ""Add to Firefox"" button.     [4] How to uninstall Cache Status extension from your Firefox?    To uninstall the extension go to Firefox -> Add-ons -> Cache Status, then press Uninstall button.

Linuxlandit & The Conqueror Penguin
The free world is the new continent in cyberspace that we have built so we can live here in freedom. It's impossible to live in freedom in the old world of cyberspace, where every program has its feudal lord that bullies and mistreats the users. So, to live in freedom we have to build a new continent. Because this is a virtual continent, it has room for everyone, and there are no immigration restrictions. - Richard Stallman -

The Fedora User Guide is focused on the end-user looking to accomplish standard desktop computer user tasks, such as browsing the web, reading and sending email, and doing office productivity work. The Fedora desktops.In contrast to most proprietary operating systems, Fedora 14 has several desktop environments or desktops that can display and launch available applications and manage the overall appearance of the screen. The desktop environment is sometimes referred to as the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Three widely-used desktops included with Fedora 14 are: GNOME, which focuses on simplicity KDE, which includes a large collection of applications and customization features Xfce, a desktop with low hardware requirements, suitable for older computers More Desktop Environments Exist! Fedora's extensive repository of software offers other desktops as well, such as Fluxbox (minimalist desktop), Sugar[2] (the desktop environment for the OLPC XO), and LXDE.With few exceptions, applications included with a particular desktop environment run in other environments too. For instance, the OpenOffice.org office suite runs on all three major desktop environments. Some applications are created specifically for a particular desktop environment. For example, each major desktop has a preferred text editor. GNOME uses Gedit and KDE supplies Kwrite, but you can install and use these in either environment. Fedora provides a wide choice of applications to browse the World Wide Web, create documents, and display and edit photos. This guide describes the most commonly installed applications on the most common desktop environments, as well as the useful alternatives. Logging in.When you restart or turn on your computer, it goes through a process called booting. During the boot process, your computer hardware powers on, performs a series of self-tests, and loads the operating system. Immediately after the computer has finished booting, the login screen appears. The login screen displays one or more user names, depending on the number of user accounts present. To log in to your accountEnter your username, using one of the following methods: Type your username and then press the Enter key. The username is case sensitive (capitalization matters; A is not the same as a). Click on your username in the list of choices. Custimize your desktop environment This step is optional. You do not normally need to choose a desktop, lauguage, or keyboard. If you skip this step, Fedora will load the default environments for your computer. Use the pull down menues at the bottom of the screen to change you desktop language or keyboard layout. To use a desktop environment other than the default choice, use the Sessions combo box on the bottom of the screen to select the desktop you wish to load before you enter your password. Enter your password in the text box and press the Enter key. Like your username, your password is case sensitive. Keep your password secret! To keep your password secret, the password field displays a dot for every character entered. As with any password, keep your account password private. Do not share it with anyone or write it down in plain view. The desktop environment now loads. In some desktop environments, a small box containing a logo and some icons called a splash screen may temporarily appear. When your splash screen (if you have one) disappears, your desktop is ready for use. You can now launch applications to access the Internet, manage files, and play media. These tasks are described in the following chapters. Logging in: a technical explanation. Fedora is a multi-user operating system. Multiple users, each with different access privileges, can be logged into the computer at the same time. During installation, you provided a password for the system administrator account, sometimes called the superuser. The user name for this account is root. After installation, Fedora asked you to set up a normal user account. Use that account, or any other such normal account, for daily use of the system, and the root account for administrative and maintenance tasks. This design has many benefits: Limited privileges reduce the possibility of doing significant damage to the entire system. Each user account has individual settings. Each user account maintains its data separate and private from others. A problem in one user account does not put the entire system at risk. Do not log in as root! Do not use the root account for routine purposes. A normal user account can run all the desktop applications, and greatly increases your security and safety. Applications that require root privileges prompt you for the root password when they need it. There is no need to log in as root to use them. I Cannot Login: help! A common mistake during login is accidentally having the Caps Lock key turned on. This situation can cause the login process to fail because usernames and passwords are case sensitive. If problems persist, re-enter your username and password a few times to ensure that you have typed them correctly. Recovering the password for a user account is not a difficult process, but it is bIf you liked this article, subscribe to the feed by clicking the image below to keep informed about new contents of the blog:

The poster wanted to include numbers for each line of output, which might look like this:


				googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1447798517240-31'); });
				

I wasn‚Äôt sure at first why you would want to do this, as this feels like text parsing and not taking advantage of PowerShell‚Äôs object nature. But I started playing along. Here‚Äôs one approach.Which gives you this:A numbered output list created with Windows PowerShell. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)That‚Äôs not¬†bad I suppose if all you want to do is look at the list or save it to a text file because all you have is text. Although, you could use it to build an interactive console menu.I‚Äôm saving the results to $menu, so that I can access them later in the example.An interactive console in Windows PowerShell. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)That‚Äôs sorta cool. But because¬†this is PowerShell, we should simply add a property.I am referencing the variable in the global scope because otherwise $i would be new for each object and everything would have a value of 1 in the Expression scriptblock. If I were to pipe this to Get-Member, I would see a new property called Item#. Given that, here‚Äôs my revised menu code:Our revised output. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)Our revised output. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)This is all fun and proof of concept stuff. There‚Äôs no error handling, and if you run it again without setting $global:i back to 0, then your numbering will be off.Everything I‚Äôve shown you thus far is an ad-hoc approach, although certainly it lends itself to scripting. Another option would be to add your own type and formatting extensions. Let‚Äôs look at the formatting options. To create a custom format, you‚Äôll need to create a .ps1xml. One way to get started is to export the current settings. Since I‚Äôm working with service objects, I can use an expression like this:You can also¬†open up $pshome\DotNetTypes.format.ps1xml in the ISE or copy and paste the relevant section into a new file. Now,¬†you can edit and create your own formatting file. Here‚Äôs what I came up with:I changed the Name setting because I will use this to reference this view. What I‚Äôm creating is in¬†addition to the normal formatting. Next, I‚Äôve created a¬†new heading for the item number.Naturally I need to provide a value.There is a concession here you have to accept. There is no easy way in the XML¬†file to initialize $global:I every time you format the results.The first time everything will look fine, but unless you reset $i it will keep increasing every time you format the output with this custom view. Once you have it complete, you can load it into your session and use it.The get-service cmdlet in Windows PowerShell. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)The get-service cmdlet in Windows PowerShell. (Image Credit: Jeff Hicks)Because this is¬†formatted output, it is pretty to look at or save to a text file, but that‚Äôs the limits of its usefulness. If you want the Item number to be a part of the object, then you‚Äôll need a custom type extension. This is actually pretty easy since we are adding a single property.However, there is the same caveat about $global:i.Although if you were using this in a script or function you could handle initializing the variable and cleaning up at the end.Finally, you could take all of this one more step and create your own custom object with its own type and formatting directives, but I‚Äôll leave that fun exercise to you.Tagged with Intermediate, PowerShell Problem Solver

Be careful about applying policy to remote servers, especially those where there is no Integrated Lights Out facility, such as VMs running on Microsoft Azure where the only way to connect is using PowerShell or a Remote Desktop Connection.There might be occasions, especially during the testing phase, where you want to rollback a security policy that you have applied. I wouldn‚Äôt rely on this as a plan for a production environment, but nevertheless it‚Äôs a handy feature.Rollback an already applied policy (Image Credit: Russell Smith)View the changes that will be rolled back (Image Credit: Russell Smith)While the Security Configuration Wizard GUI is great for working with single servers, once you‚Äôve created a policy, you might like to apply and manage it centrally across multiple devices. Fortunately, the command line version of the tool allows us to do just that.The new GPO will be created in Active Directory, but not linked to an Organizational Unit (OU). That you must do yourself using the Group Policy Management tool, which can be found on the Tools menu in Server Manager.It is always preferable to use Group Policy to manage computers on a network where possible, but there are situations where servers are not members of an Active Directory domain so can‚Äôt be managed using Group Policy. Again using the command line version of SCW, you can apply a policy to more than one server.Create a config file containing a list of servers and security policies (Image Credit: Russell Smith)The /t: parameter is used to specify the number of working threads, which is useful if you want to apply policy to many servers, and /u: to specify the user account that will authenticate on the remote servers.Apply a policy to multiple servers from the command line (Image Credit: Russell Smith)You‚Äôll then be shown a progress monitor and informed when the operation has completed. You can see the resulting logs on each server under %windir%\security\msscw\logs, although they are not particularly informative.Now that a security policy has been applied to a remote server, you can use scwcmd.exe to check that it has been applied successfully.When the analyze command has completed, you can check the results in the working directory of the command prompt. Unfortunately, the report is a little incomprehensible, although you will find buried in there information about whether the server passed checks for each section of the security policy.Tagged with Authentication, Security Configuration Wizard, windows firewall

180,8710994,Resume Builder Review: Resume Genius,http://www.jobscan.co/blog/2014/12/05/resume-builder-review-resume-genius/,2014,"A resume builder is a useful tool for job seekers¬†wanting a convenient way to create polished-looking resumes. To help job seekers find the best resume builder for their situation, we‚Äôre publishing a series of reviews. Today, we‚Äôre featuring Resume Genius.Resume Genius claims that 92 percent of users land an interview within 30 days of using the resume builder. In addition to the resume builder, Resume Genius has several career resources, such as a list of common job interview questions. Perhaps most useful is this list of more than 100 educational websites where visitors can learn new skills or brush up on existing ones.A screenshot from the Resume Genius homepage.Getting startedYou can get started right away with Resume Genius‚Äîno need to sign up for an account first. To begin the process of building your resume, you‚Äôre prompted to choose from one of eight resume templates. (If you want to change your mind later, you can.) Most of the templates are laid out similarly; half use color and half don‚Äôt. If you opt for a template that uses color, keep in mind that the so-called ‚Äústriking green‚Äù used on two of the templates isn‚Äôt necessarily easy on the eyes.This resume template prominently features plenty of ‚Äústriking green‚Äù text. Make sure the template you choose is easy to read.Once you‚Äôve chosen a template, the resume builder has you manually enter your contact information, work history, education history, and skills. This might feel a bit tedious, but it‚Äôs a better alternative than having to hunt through a resume draft to make sure the tool didn‚Äôt parse any information incorrectly.If you feel at all overwhelmed¬†by the process of writing a resume (a common situation‚Äîit can be tough to distill what you spend most of your time doing into just a few bullet points), you‚Äôll find the Resume Genius resume builder immensely helpful. After you enter your job title, you can either add your own job-related information, or choose from suggestions provided by Resume Genius. Below, see a screenshot of just a few suggestions for the role of operations manager.A handful of suggested bullet points for operations managers.Even if you don‚Äôt use the specific wording they offer (there are more than 50,000 entries covering almost countless roles and industries), it‚Äôs an unbeatable brainstorming tool. It‚Äôs worth browsing related job titles and taking notes for future resume writing.EditingThe contents of each template can be adjusted to suit your individual needs. You can enable, disable, rename, or add sections as you choose. (Despite the fact that one is¬†pictured in each sample resume template, you don‚Äôt have to use a resume objective). If you want to add a section, there are nine existing offerings, plus the option to create a custom section.¬†One particularly great feature is that, for your work experience section, you can choose whether you want to use a traditional resume format or a functional resume format. This is perfect for people considering a career change.Unfortunately, there is one big drawback to the editing process: You can‚Äôt control the details of the template itself. As the screenshot below shows, the resume builder abbreviated ‚ÄúJune‚Äù in the education section, but not in the work experience section. There are a number of roles¬†where attention to detail is so highly valued that this inconsistency would get your resume instantly rejected.Resume Genius abbreviates ‚ÄúJune‚Äù in the education section, but not in the work experience section.PricingFor $1.95, you can create and download unlimited resumes and cover letters for 14 days. After that trial period, you‚Äôll automatically be charged $39.95 per month for a subscription. Alternatively, you can pay in full for a year-long subscription that works out to $7.95 per month. The annual subscription also automatically renews. In both cases, the onus is on you to cancel your membership.Pricing for Resume Genius is subscription-based and renews automatically. You must take action to cancel your membership when you are finished.If you are interested in using a resume builder and want help brainstorming ideas for your resume‚Äôs contents, Resume Genius is definitely worth your time.See also:Resume Format: Your Education SectionShould You Use a Resume Objective?10 Awesome Resume Templatesevolve theme by Theme4Press¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†Powered by WordPress"
181,8977209,3 job search tips from Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll,http://www.jobscan.co/blog/2015/01/30/three-job-search-tips-seahawks-coach-pete-carroll/,2015,"Three Job Search Tips from Seahawks Coach Pete CarrollI‚Äôm putting all objectivity to the side for the day, because I‚Äôm a huge Seattle Seahawks fan and I can‚Äôt wait for this weekend‚Äôs Super Bowl. It‚Äôs been a pleasure watching Pete Carroll shape the Seahawks since taking over as head coach in 2010. His positivity and energy are unique in the NFL, and distinguish him from surly and scheming coaches such as New England‚Äôs Bill Belichick. Many of his methods and philosophies have applications outside of football. These three job search tips are directly inspired by Carroll and his undeniable success.Find your John SchneiderOne of the unusual things about Carroll‚Äôs time with the Seahawks is that he hired John Schneider, the general manager. (When hired by the Seahawks, Carroll was made executive vice president of football operations in addition to his role as head coach.) Schneider is Carroll‚Äôs closest advisor, and the team‚Äôs success is evidence of their ability to work together.Every job seeker should have their own John Schneider: someone they trust, someone who will take their strengths and weaknesses into consideration, someone who can help them evaluate opportunities for the right timing and the right fit, and someone who will help keep the big picture in mind.Percy Harvin is a football player of spectacular ability. But he was not the right fit for the Seahawks‚Äô offense or locker room, and Carroll and Schneider traded him away partway through this season. An opportunity that looks good on paper may not be good for you in practice, and having someone who can serve as your sounding board, offer perspective, and help keep your job search on track is essential.Always competeContinually striving for excellence is a huge part of Carroll‚Äôs coaching philosophy. While I leapt off my couch in excitement when we drafted quarterback Russell Wilson in 2012, it seemed unlikely that he would start as a rookie‚Äîespecially since the Seahawks had recently spent $10 million to acquire quarterback Matt Flynn. But, as everyone knows by now, Wilson won the starting job as a result of his talent and work ethic. Carroll makes his personnel choices based on performance, not on expectations.Starting Flynn would have been the safe and expected choice, but Carroll doesn‚Äôt operate that way. The Seahawks are known for turning undrafted free agents‚Äîsuch as Doug Baldwin and Jermaine Kearse, both of whom caught touchdown passes in last year‚Äôs Super Bowl‚Äîinto household names.Carroll and the Seahawks reward performance, not reputation. Prior accomplishments aren‚Äôt a guarantee of playing time. Showing up and proving yourself is how to succeed as a Seahawk. From this, job seekers can learn the importance of positioning themselves as the winning candidate. A job search is a competition, after all; according to ERE Media, each corporate job opening receives an average of 250 resumes. 249 of those people aren‚Äôt going to get the job. What can you do to be the one who does?In a job market filled with applicants firing off as many applications as possible, you can stand out by tailoring your application materials every time you submit an application. To anyone who‚Äôs hiring, the difference between a targeted resume and a generic resume is readily apparent. A targeted resume shows that you are thoughtful, and interested in that particular job. That alone raises your profile as a candidate. A targeted resume also makes you far more likely to be rated highly by an applicant tracking system.Think of an ATS as a football organization‚Äôs draft board. To rank highly on a team‚Äôs draft board, you have to make it obvious that you have the skills and experience they want. Using the right resume keywords and focusing on accomplishments¬†(not tasks) are two ways of doing that. To see how well your resume matches up with a particular job opportunity, paste your resume and the job description into Jobscan‚Äôs resume analysis tool. You‚Äôll get instant feedback telling you how highly a system is likely to rate your resume, plus suggestions for changes and improvements.Each interview is a chance to go 1-0A key belief that Carroll has instilled in the Seahawks organization is that every week is a championship opportunity‚Äîthat no one week is bigger, or more important, than any other week. This philosophy is consistent from the preseason through the playoffs. Good preparation is key. As Wilson always says, ‚ÄúThe separation is in the preparation.‚Äù Discipline, good habits, and not psyching yourself out‚Äîthese are some of the keys to Carroll‚Äôs philosophy. No matter how big the stage, Carroll makes sure his team prepares in the same way every time.Job seekers can apply these ideas to their job search as well. Every interview is a chance to go 1-0, a chance to win. Be confident, be consistent, be prepared, and walk into every interview with the knowledge that someone has to win‚Äîthat is, someone has to get the job‚Äîso why not you? Nerves are natural, but by focusing on your preparation and doing well in the moment, you can be as unflappable in the Seahawks. Even in the face of incredibly long odds‚Äîsay, being down 19-7 with four minutes left in the game and a trip to the Super Bowl on the line‚Äîthey believe in themselves and they play to win. Fake field goals that lead to touchdowns, scrambling two-point conversions, collecting onside kicks‚Äîthese are all things that the Seahawks practiced. They were prepared, and when the game was on the line, they executed. Thorough preparation beforehand translates into performing when it matters, whether the scenario is an NFL conference championship¬†game or a job interview.Pete Carroll‚Äôs optimism and winning ways have made him hugely popular with his players and with his adopted city of Seattle. He‚Äôs an outstanding role model, and if you‚Äôre looking for job search tips, you can‚Äôt go wrong with applying some of Pete Carroll‚Äôs philosophies to your job hunt.Good luck.

Many companies have viewed a website as an office today. Many businesses consider a website as more beneficial than the traditional office space because;The best thing about having a website is that you can use it for whatever purpose you deem fit. You can increase the number of viewers to your site and optimize your website by doing simple things, and you are sure to get results.Having plenty of content on your website is important, but the most important aspect of your site should be the quality of your content. Quality content will lead your readers coming back to read more. Quality content will also result in other people visiting your website, as they believe you have some valuable information on the subject matter. Quality always supersedes quantity in matters SEO. You should also update your content often, this ensures that your website‚Äôs content stays valuable to your readers, and they will feel as though you are always researching the matter.The title of your articles should be catchy and witty; you should try, to summarize, your article with the fewest words possible through the title.

The title is the first thing that the reader will notice about your article, and this is your sole opportunity to grab their attention, make sure it counts. Your Meta title and description should be catchy as well; they also largely determine visitors to your website.Your in-text links should give the reader as much information on what the link is about. The probability of someone clicking on a well-defined link always overshadows the ‚Äòclick here‚Äô links. A descriptive link assures the reader that you are not just another spammer or you have very little knowledge on the subject matter. You can use links more efficiently on the keywords and subheadings, as more people are likely to click on such phrases.You should never overuse the keyword in the article, and this just leads to poor ranking. The search engine engineers will always notice such tricks and will mark you as a spammer; this will result in lower SEO ranking.

It is very easy to set up and easy to navigate. The most recent purchase of an Apple TV was for my parents who, whilst not being technophobes, often find new pieces of technology a challenge: they took to using this like a duck to water! We deliberately purchased a 3rd generation as we felt the older remote was actually easier to use. They have really enjoyed the product and all it offers. I would highly recommend it.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Pre-ownedSmart looking, sleek design, easy set up.Great device overall. Bit dissaapointed that it does not have BBC i player and other english tv platform hubs apart from now tv and sky news. But it does now include the wwe network. Good buy over all. Hope more features will be added in the near future. Would recommend you open an i tunes account before purchasing, this will however require handing over bank/credit or debit card details.Works well with iPhone and iPad and has NOW TV app built in.If you have Apple kit then this is very useful. You can view your iPhone on TV (mirroring) and show individual photos and videos as well.

The only UK service I have seen is NOW TV which is great for me as I can turn off that separate box.

You have access to iCloud photos and your music on iTunes. You can rent and buy movies from Apple as well.

All round a good TV Box.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: Pre-ownedTrending price is based on prices over last 90 days.Trending price is based on prices over last 90 days."

David Fincher already has tackled one Silicon Valley billionaire in¬†Mark Zuckerberg. Now, the¬†Social Network director is poised to take on the late Steve Jobs for Sony.Fincher is in early talks to helm the untitled film based on Walter Isaacson‚Äôs best-selling biography of the Apple co-founder, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. If a deal comes together, the film would reunite the director with Oscar-winning Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin, who recently finished the adaptation, and Social Network producer Scott Rudin. Mark Gordon¬†and Guymon Casady also are producing.PHOTOS: 35 of 2014's Most Anticipated Movies: 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' 'Mockingjay,' 'Spider-Man 2'Like Zuckerberg, Jobs was a complicated visionary who became a polarizing figure. Under Jobs' watch, Apple revolutionized several businesses, including personal computers, music, computer-generated animation and mobile phones. In the process, he became known as one of the greatest innovators of his generation. At the same time, he was unapologetic about his difficult personality, was at one point ousted at Apple and was criticized for the company's harsh treatment of workers in China who assembled Apple products.Jobs' life already has inspired one big-screen feature: Open Road's 2011 film Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher, which grossed just $35 million worldwide. But the Sorkin-penned project is considered a much more high-profile project due to the pedigree of those involved and the popularity of Isaacson's book, for which he obtained unrivaled access to Jobs during the last years of his life.Sony boarded the project in October 2011, just weeks after Jobs succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Sorkin began writing the script in 2012, though he also has been heavily involved in his HBO series The Newsroom. No actor is attached yet, though the chance to play Jobs for Fincher and Sorkin likely would pique the interest of many A-list stars. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is participating in the film as a consultant.PHOTOS: Facebook Turns 10: The Social Network's Most Popular Stars, Movies and TV ShowsFincher is a notoriously picky director who can go years between film projects. He last directed Sony‚Äôs The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which Rudin produced. Though the 2011 film was well received and earned more than $200 million worldwide, it never spawned a second and third chapter, as originally planned.He recently finished shooting the Fox/New Regency mystery Gone Girl, based on Gillian Flynn‚Äôs best-seller. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star. Fincher also just launched season two of the critically acclaimed Netflix series House of Cards, which he executive produces. Fincher and Flynn also are reteaming on the HBO series Utopia.Fincher is repped by manager Joshua Donen and attorney Craig Jacobson.Email: Tatiana.Siegel@THR.com

203,1551515,No Secrets: Julian Assange‚Äôs (WikiLeaks') Mission for Total Transparency,http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all,2010,"by Aaron Badyby Robert Mankoffby Virgin Serpellby Dorothy Wickendenby Andy Borowitzby Robert Mankoffby Ian Crouchby John CassidyThe house on Grettisgata Street, in Reykjavik, is a century old, small and white, situated just a few streets from the North Atlantic. The shifting northerly winds can suddenly bring ice and snow to the city, even in springtime, and when they do a certain kind of silence sets in. This was the case on the morning of March 30th, when a tall Australian man named Julian Paul Assange, with gray eyes and a mop of silver-white hair, arrived to rent the place. Assange was dressed in a gray full-body snowsuit, and he had with him a small entourage. ‚ÄúWe are journalists,‚Äù he told the owner of the house. Eyjafjallaj√∂kull had recently begun erupting, and he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to write about the volcano.‚Äù After the owner left, Assange quickly closed the drapes, and he made sure that they stayed closed, day and night. The house, as far as he was concerned, would now serve as a war room; people called it the Bunker. Half a dozen computers were set up in a starkly decorated, white-walled living space. Icelandic activists arrived, and they began to work, more or less at Assange‚Äôs direction, around the clock. Their focus was Project B‚ÄîAssange‚Äôs code name for a thirty-eight-minute video taken from the cockpit of an Apache military helicopter in Iraq in 2007. The video depicted American soldiers killing at least eighteen people, including two Reuters journalists; it later became the subject of widespread controversy, but at this early stage it was still a closely guarded military secret. Assange is an international trafficker, of sorts. He and his colleagues collect documents and imagery that governments and other institutions regard as confidential and publish them on a Web site called WikiLeaks.org. Since it went online, three and a half years ago, the site has published an extensive catalogue of secret material, ranging from the Standard Operating Procedures at Camp Delta, in Guant√°namo Bay, and the ‚ÄúClimategate‚Äù e-mails from the University of East Anglia, in England, to the contents of Sarah Palin‚Äôs private Yahoo account. The catalogue is especially remarkable because WikiLeaks is not quite an organization; it is better described as a media insurgency. It has no paid staff, no copiers, no desks, no office. Assange does not even have a home. He travels from country to country, staying with supporters, or friends of friends‚Äîas he once put it to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living in airports these days.‚Äù He is the operation‚Äôs prime mover, and it is fair to say that WikiLeaks exists wherever he does. At the same time, hundreds of volunteers from around the world help maintain the Web site‚Äôs complicated infrastructure; many participate in small ways, and between three and five people dedicate themselves to it full time. Key members are known only by initials‚ÄîM, for instance‚Äîeven deep within WikiLeaks, where communications are conducted by encrypted online chat services. The secretiveness stems from the belief that a populist intelligence operation with virtually no resources, designed to publicize information that powerful institutions do not want public, will have serious adversaries. Iceland was a natural place to develop Project B. In the past year, Assange has collaborated with politicians and activists there to draft a free-speech law of unprecedented strength, and a number of these same people had agreed to help him work on the video in total secrecy. The video was a striking artifact‚Äîan unmediated representation of the ambiguities and cruelties of modern warfare‚Äîand he hoped that its release would touch off a worldwide debate about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was planning to unveil the footage before a group of reporters at the National Press Club, in Washington, on April 5th, the morning after Easter, presumably a slow news day. To accomplish this, he and the other members of the WikiLeaks community would have to analyze the raw video and edit it into a short film, build a stand-alone Web site to display it, launch a media campaign, and prepare documentation for the footage‚Äîall in less than a week‚Äôs time. Assange also wanted to insure that, once the video was posted online, it would be impossible to remove. He told me that WikiLeaks maintains its content on more than twenty servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names. (Expenses are paid by donations, and a few independent well-wishers also run ‚Äúmirror sites‚Äù in support.) Assange calls the site ‚Äúan uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking and public analysis,‚Äù and a government or company that wanted to remove content from WikiLeaks would have to practically dismantle the Internet itself. So far, even though the site has received more than a hundred legal threats, almost no one has filed suit. Lawyers working for the British bank Northern Rock threatened court action after the site published an embarrassing memo, but they were practically reduced to begging. A Kenyan politician also vowed to sue after Assange published a confidential report alleging that President Daniel arap Moi and his allies had siphoned billions of dollars out of the country. The site‚Äôs work in Kenya earned it an award from Amnesty International. Assange typically tells would-be litigants to go to hell. In 2008, WikiLeaks posted secret Scientology manuals, and lawyers representing the church demanded that they be removed. Assange‚Äôs response was to publish more of the Scientologists‚Äô internal material, and to announce, ‚ÄúWikiLeaks will not comply with legally abusive requests from Scientology any more than WikiLeaks has complied with similar demands from Swiss banks, Russian offshore stem-cell centers, former African kleptocrats, or the Pentagon.‚Äù In his writing online, especially on Twitter, Assange is quick to lash out at perceived enemies. By contrast, on television, where he has been appearing more frequently, he acts with uncanny sang-froid. Under the studio lights, he can seem‚Äîwith his spectral white hair, pallid skin, cool eyes, and expansive forehead‚Äîlike a rail-thin being who has rocketed to Earth to deliver humanity some hidden truth. This impression is magnified by his rigid demeanor and his baritone voice, which he deploys slowly, at low volume. In private, however, Assange is often bemused and energetic. He can concentrate intensely, in binges, but he is also the kind of person who will forget to reserve a plane ticket, or reserve a plane ticket and forget to pay for it, or pay for the ticket and forget to go to the airport. People around him seem to want to care for him; they make sure that he is where he needs to be, and that he has not left all his clothes in the dryer before moving on. At such times, he can seem innocent of the considerable influence that he has acquired. Sitting at a small wooden table in the Bunker, Assange looked exhausted. His lanky frame was arched over two computers‚Äîone of them online, and the other disconnected from the Internet, because it was full of classified military documents. (In the tradecraft of espionage, this is known as maintaining an ‚Äúair gap.‚Äù) He has a cyber-security analyst‚Äôs concern about computer vulnerability, and habitually takes precautions to frustrate eavesdroppers. A low-grade fever of paranoia runs through the WikiLeaks community. Assange says that he has chased away strangers who have tried to take his picture for surveillance purposes. In March, he published a classified military report, created by the Army Counterintelligence Center in 2008, that argued that the site was a potential threat to the Army and briefly speculated on ways to deter government employees from leaking documents to it. Assange regarded the report as a declaration of war, and posted it with the title ‚ÄúU.S. Intelligence Planned to Destroy WikiLeaks.‚Äù During a trip to a conference before he came to the Bunker, he thought he was being followed, and his fear began to infect others. ‚ÄúI went to Sweden and stayed with a girl who is a foreign editor of a newspaper there, and she became so paranoid that the C.I.A. was trying to get me she left the house and abandoned me,‚Äù he said. Assange was sitting opposite Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch activist, hacker, and businessman. Gonggrijp‚Äîthin and balding, with a soft voice‚Äîhas known Assange well for several years. He had noticed Assange‚Äôs panicky communiqu√©s about being watched and decided that his help was needed. ‚ÄúJulian can deal with incredibly little sleep, and a hell of a lot of chaos, but even he has his limits, and I could see that he was stretching himself,‚Äù Gonggrijp told me. ‚ÄúI decided to come out and make things sane again.‚Äù Gonggrijp became the unofficial manager and treasurer of Project B, advancing about ten thousand euros to WikiLeaks to finance it. He kept everyone on schedule, and made sure that the kitchen was stocked with food and that the Bunker was orderly. At around three in the afternoon, an Icelandic parliamentarian named Birgitta Jonsdottir walked in. Jonsdottir, who is in her forties, with long brown hair and bangs, was wearing a short black skirt and a black T-shirt with skulls printed on it. She took a WikiLeaks T-shirt from her bag and tossed it at Assange. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou need to change.‚Äù He put the T-shirt on a chair next to him, and continued working. Jonsdottir has been in parliament for about a year, but considers herself a poet, artist, writer, and activist. Her political views are mostly anarchist. ‚ÄúI was actually unemployed before I got this job,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúWhen we first got to parliament, the staff was so nervous: here are people who were protesting parliament, who were for revolution, and now we are inside. None of us had aspirations to be politicians. We have a checklist, and, once we‚Äôre done, we are out.‚Äù As she unpacked her computer, she asked Assange how he was planning to delegate the work on Project B. More Icelandic activists were due to arrive; half a dozen ultimately contributed time to the video, and about as many WikiLeaks volunteers from other countries were participating. Assange suggested that someone make contact with Google to insure that YouTube would host the footage.‚ÄúTo make sure it is not taken down under pressure?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThey have a rule that mentions gratuitous violence,‚Äù Assange said. ‚ÄúThe violence is not gratuitous in this case, but nonetheless they have taken things down. It is too important to be interfered with.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat can we ask M to do?‚Äù Jonsdottir asked. Assange, engrossed in what he was doing, didn‚Äôt reply. His concerns about surveillance had not entirely receded. On March 26th, he had written a blast e-mail, titled ‚ÄúSomething Is Rotten in the State of Iceland,‚Äù in which he described a teen-age Icelandic WikiLeaks volunteer‚Äôs story of being detained by local police for more than twenty hours. The volunteer was arrested for trying to break into the factory where his father worked‚Äî‚Äúthe reasons he was trying to get in are not totally justified,‚Äù Assange told me‚Äîand said that while in custody he was interrogated about Project B. Assange claimed that the volunteer was ‚Äúshown covert photos of me outside the Reykjavik restaurant Icelandic Fish & Chips,‚Äù where a WikiLeaks production meeting had taken place in a private back room. The police were denying key parts of the volunteer‚Äôs story, and Assange was trying to learn more. He received a call, and after a few minutes hung up. ‚ÄúOur young friend talked to one of the cops,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was about to get more details, but my battery died.‚Äù He smiled and looked suspiciously at his phone.‚ÄúWe are all paranoid schizophrenics,‚Äù Jonsdottir said. She gestured at Assange, who was still wearing his snowsuit. ‚ÄúJust look at how he dresses.‚Äù Gonggrijp got up, walked to the window, and parted the drapes to peer out. ‚ÄúSomeone?‚Äù Jonsdottir asked. ‚ÄúJust the camera van,‚Äù he deadpanned. ‚ÄúThe brain-manipulation van.‚Äù At around six in the evening, Assange got up from his spot at the table. He was holding a hard drive containing Project B. The video‚Äîexcerpts of running footage captured by a camera mounted on the Apache‚Äîdepicts soldiers conducting an operation in eastern Baghdad, not long after the surge began. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Reuters has sought for three years to obtain the video from the Army, without success. Assange would not identify his source, saying only that the person was unhappy about the attack. The video was digitally encrypted, and it took WikiLeaks three months to crack. Assange, a cryptographer of exceptional skill, told me that unlocking the file was ‚Äúmoderately difficult.‚Äù People gathered in front of a computer to watch. In grainy black-and-white, we join the crew of the Apache, from the Eighth Cavalry Regiment, as it hovers above Baghdad with another helicopter. A wide-angle shot frames a mosque‚Äôs dome in crosshairs. We see a jumble of buildings and palm trees and abandoned streets. We hear bursts of static, radio blips, and the clipped banter of tactical communication. Two soldiers are in mid-conversation; the first recorded words are ‚ÄúO.K., I got it.‚Äù Assange hit the pause button, and said, ‚ÄúIn this video, you will see a number of people killed.‚Äù The footage, he explained, had three broad phases. ‚ÄúIn the first phase, you will see an attack that is based upon a mistake, but certainly a very careless mistake. In the second part, the attack is clearly murder, according to the definition of the average man. And in the third part you will see the killing of innocent civilians in the course of soldiers going after a legitimate target.‚ÄùThe first phase was chilling, in part because the banter of the soldiers was so far beyond the boundaries of civilian discourse. ‚ÄúJust fuckin‚Äô, once you get on ‚Äôem, just open ‚Äôem up,‚Äù one of them said. The crew members of the Apache came upon about a dozen men ambling down a street, a block or so from American troops, and reported that five or six of the men were armed with AK-47s; as the Apache maneuvered into position to fire at them, the crew saw one of the Reuters journalists, who were mixed in among the other men, and mistook a long-lensed camera for an RPG. The Apaches fired on the men for twenty-five seconds, killing nearly all of them instantly. Phase two began shortly afterward. As the helicopter hovered over the carnage, the crew noticed a wounded survivor struggling on the ground. The man appeared to be unarmed. ‚ÄúAll you gotta do is pick up a weapon,‚Äù a soldier in the Apache said. Suddenly, a van drove into view, and three unarmed men rushed to help the wounded person. ‚ÄúWe have individuals going to the scene, looks like possibly, uh, picking up bodies and weapons,‚Äù the Apache reported, even though the men were helping a survivor, and were not collecting weapons. The Apache fired, killing the men and the person they were trying to save, and wounding two young children in the van‚Äôs front seat. In phase three, the helicopter crew radioed a commander to say that at least six armed men had entered a partially constructed building in a dense urban area. Some of the armed men may have walked over from a skirmish with American troops; it is unclear. The crew asked for permission to attack the structure, which they said appeared abandoned. ‚ÄúWe can put a missile in it,‚Äù a soldier in the Apache suggested, and the go-ahead was quickly given. Moments later, two unarmed people entered the building. Though the soldiers acknowledged them, the attack proceeded: three Hellfire missiles destroyed the building. Passersby were engulfed by clouds of debris. Assange saw these events in sharply delineated moral terms, yet the footage did not offer easy legal judgments. In the month before the video was shot, members of the battalion on the ground, from the Sixteenth Infantry Regiment, had suffered more than a hundred and fifty attacks and roadside bombings, nineteen injuries, and four deaths; early that morning, the unit had been attacked by small-arms fire. The soldiers in the Apache were matter-of-fact about killing and spoke callously about their victims, but the first attack could be judged as a tragic misunderstanding. The attack on the van was questionable‚Äîthe use of force seemed neither thoughtful nor measured‚Äîbut soldiers are permitted to shoot combatants, even when they are assisting the wounded, and one could argue that the Apache‚Äôs crew, in the heat of the moment, reasonably judged the men in the van to be assisting the enemy. Phase three may have been unlawful, perhaps negligent homicide or worse. Firing missiles into a building, in daytime, to kill six people who do not appear to be of strategic importance is an excessive use of force. This attack was conducted with scant deliberation, and it is unclear why the Army did not investigate it. Assange had obtained internal Army records of the operation, which stated that everyone killed, except for the Reuters journalists, was an insurgent. And the day after the incident an Army spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThere is no question that Coalition Forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force.‚Äù Assange was hoping that Project B would undermine the Army‚Äôs official narrative. ‚ÄúThis video shows what modern warfare has become, and, I think, after seeing it, whenever people hear about a certain number of casualties that resulted during fighting with close air support, they will understand what is going on,‚Äù he said in the Bunker. ‚ÄúThe video also makes clear that civilians are listed as insurgents automatically, unless they are children, and that bystanders who are killed are not even mentioned.‚Äù WikiLeaks receives about thirty submissions a day, and typically posts the ones it deems credible in their raw, unedited state, with commentary alongside. Assange told me, ‚ÄúI want to set up a new standard: ‚Äòscientific journalism.‚Äô If you publish a paper on DNA, you are required, by all the good biological journals, to submit the data that has informed your research‚Äîthe idea being that people will replicate it, check it, verify it. So this is something that needs to be done for journalism as well. There is an immediate power imbalance, in that readers are unable to verify what they are being told, and that leads to abuse.‚Äù Because Assange publishes his source material, he believes that WikiLeaks is free to offer its analysis, no matter how speculative. In the case of Project B, Assange wanted to edit the raw footage into a short film as a vehicle for commentary. For a while, he thought about calling the film ‚ÄúPermission to Engage,‚Äù but ultimately decided on something more forceful: ‚ÄúCollateral Murder.‚Äù He told Gonggrijp, ‚ÄúWe want to knock out this ‚Äòcollateral damage‚Äô euphemism, and so when anyone uses it they will think ‚Äòcollateral murder.‚Äô ‚Äú The video, in its original form, was a puzzle‚Äîa fragment of evidence divorced from context. Assange and the others in the Bunker spent much of their time trying to piece together details: the units involved, their command structure, the rules of engagement, the jargon soldiers used on the radio, and, most important, whether and how the Iraqis on the ground were armed. ‚ÄúOne of them has a weapon,‚Äù Assange said, peering at blurry footage of the men walking down the street. ‚ÄúSee all those people standing out there.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd there is a guy with an RPG over his arm,‚Äù Gonggrijp said.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù Assange said. ‚ÄúIt does look a little bit like an RPG.‚Äù He played the footage again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what is very strange,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf it is an RPG, then there is just one RPG. Where are all the other weapons? All those guys. It is pretty weird.‚ÄùThe forensic work was made more difficult because Assange had declined to discuss the matter with military officials. ‚ÄúI thought it would be more harmful than helpful,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI have approached them before, and, as soon as they hear it is WikiLeaks, they are not terribly co√∂perative.‚Äù Assange was running Project B as a surprise attack. He had encouraged a rumor that the video was shot in Afghanistan in 2009, in the hope that the Defense Department would be caught unprepared. Assange does not believe that the military acts in good faith with the media. He said to me, ‚ÄúWhat right does this institution have to know the story before the public?‚ÄùThis adversarial mind-set permeated the Bunker. Late one night, an activist asked if Assange might be detained upon his arrival in the United States. ‚ÄúIf there is ever a time it was safe for me to go, it is now,‚Äù Assange assured him.‚ÄúThey say that Gitmo is nice this time of year,‚Äù Gonggrijp said.Assange was the sole decision-maker, and it was possible to leave the house at night and come back after sunrise and see him in the same place, working. (‚ÄúI spent two months in one room in Paris once without leaving,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople were handing me food.‚Äù) He spoke to the team in shorthand‚Äî‚ÄúI need the conversion stuff,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMake sure that credit-card donations are acceptable‚Äù‚Äîall the while resolving flareups with the overworked volunteers. To keep track of who was doing what, Gonggrijp and another activist maintained a workflow chart with yellow Post-Its on the kitchen cabinets. Elsewhere, people were translating the video‚Äôs subtitles into various languages, or making sure that servers wouldn‚Äôt crash from the traffic that was expected after the video was posted. Assange wanted the families of the Iraqis who had died in the attack to be contacted, to prepare them for the inevitable media attention, and to gather additional information. In conjunction with Iceland‚Äôs national broadcasting service, RUV, he sent two Icelandic journalists to Baghdad to find them.By the end of the week, a frame-by-frame examination of the footage was nearly complete, revealing minute details‚Äîevidence of a body on the ground, for instance‚Äîthat were not visible by casual viewing. (‚ÄúI am about twelve thousand frames in,‚Äù the activist who reviewed it told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a morbid day, going through these people‚Äôs last moments.‚Äù) Assange had decided to exclude the Hellfire incident from the film; the attack lacked the obvious human dimension of the others, and he thought that viewers might be overloaded with information. The edited film, which was eighteen minutes long, began with a quote from George Orwell that Assange and M had selected: ‚ÄúPolitical language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give the appearance of solidity to pure wind.‚Äù It then presented information about the journalists who had been killed, and about the official response to the attack. For the audio of this section, one of the film‚Äôs Icelandic editors had layered in fragments of radio banter from the soldiers. As Assange reviewed the cut, an activist named Gudmundur Gudmundsson spoke up to say that the banter allowed viewers to ‚Äúmake an emotional bond‚Äù with the soldiers. Assange argued that it was mostly fragmentary and garbled, but Gudmundsson insisted: ‚ÄúIt is just used all the time for triggering emotions.‚Äù‚ÄúAt the same time, we are displaying them as monsters,‚Äù the editor said. ‚ÄúBut emotions always rule,‚Äù Gudmundsson said. ‚ÄúBy the way, I worked on the sound recording for a film, ‚ÄòChildren of Nature,‚Äô that was nominated for an Oscar, so I am speaking from experience.‚Äù‚ÄúWell, what is your alternative?‚Äù Assange asked. ‚ÄúBasically, bursts of sounds, interrupting the quiet,‚Äù he said. The editor made the change, stripping the voices of the soldiers from the opening, but keeping blips and whirs of radio distortion. Assange gave the edit his final approval. Late Saturday night, shortly before all the work had to be finished, the journalists who had gone to Baghdad sent Assange an e-mail: they had found the two children in the van. The children had lived a block from the location of the attack, and were being driven to school by their father that morning. ‚ÄúThey remember the bombardment, felt great pain, they said, and lost consciousness,‚Äù one of the journalists wrote. The journalists also found the owner of the building that had been attacked by the Hellfires, who said that families had been living in the structure, and that seven residents had died. The owner, a retired English teacher, had lost his wife and daughter. An intense discussion arose about what to do with this news: Was it worth using at the National Press Club, or was it a better tactic to hold on to it? If the military justified the Hellfire attacks by claiming that there were no civilian casualties, WikiLeaks could respond by releasing the information, in a kind of ambush. Jonsdottir turned to Gonggrijp, whose eyes had welled up. ‚ÄúAre you crying?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúO.K., O.K., it is just the kids. It hurts.‚Äù Gonggrijp gathered himself. ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù he said. Resuming the conversation about ambushing the Army, he said, ‚ÄúAnyway, let them walk into this knife‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is a wonderful thing to do,‚Äù one of the activists said. ‚ÄúLet them walk into this, and they will,‚Äù Gonggrijp said. ‚ÄúIt is a logical response.‚ÄùJonsdottir was now in tears, too, and wiping her nose. ‚ÄúNow I want to re√´dit the thing,‚Äù Assange said. ‚ÄúI want to put in the missile attack. There were three families living in the bottom, so it wasn‚Äôt abandoned.‚Äù But it was impossible to re√´dit the film. The activists were working at capacity, and in several hours it would be Easter. At half past ten in the morning, Gonggrijp pulled open the drapes, and the Bunker was filled with sunlight. He was wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt and black pants, freshly washed and ironed, and he was struggling to keep everyone on schedule. Last-minute concerns‚Äîamong them finding a criminal-defense lawyer in the United States‚Äîwere being addressed. Assange was at a computer, his posture upright as he steadily typed. ‚ÄúHow are we on time?‚Äù he asked no one in particular. &quot;We have three hours,&quot; Gonggrijp said.Assange wrinkled his brow and turned his attention back to the screen. He was looking at a copy of classified rules of engagement in Iraq from 2006, one of several secret American military documents that he was planning to post with the video. WikiLeaks scrubs such documents to insure that no digital traces embedded in them can identify their source. Assange was purging these traces as fast as he could. Reykjavik‚Äôs streets were empty, and the bells of a cathedral began to toll. ‚ÄúRemember, remember the fifth of November,‚Äù Assange said, repeating a line from the English folk poem celebrating Guy Fawkes. He smiled, as Gonggrijp dismantled the workflow chart, removing Post-Its from the cabinets and flushing them down the toilet. Shortly before noon, there was a desperate push to clear away the remaining vestiges of Project B and to get to the airport. Assange was unpacked and unshaven, and his hair was a mess. He was typing up a press release. Jonsdottir came by to help, and he asked her, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you cut my hair while I‚Äôm doing this?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, I am not going to cut your hair while you are working,‚Äù she said. Jonsdottir walked over to the sink and made tea. Assange kept on typing, and after a few minutes she reluctantly began to trim his hair. At one point, she stopped and asked, ‚ÄúIf you get arrested, will you get in touch with me?‚Äù Assange nodded. Gonggrijp, meanwhile, shoved some of Assange‚Äôs things into a bag. He settled the bill with the owner. Dishes were washed. Furniture was put back in place. People piled into a small car, and in an instant the house was empty and still. The name Assange is thought to derive from Ah Sang, or Mr. Sang, a Chinese √©migr√© who settled on Thursday Island, off the coast of Australia, in the early eighteen-hundreds, and whose descendants later moved to the continent. Assange‚Äôs maternal ancestors came to Australia in the mid-nineteenth century, from Scotland and Ireland, in search of farmland, and Assange suspects, only half in jest, that his proclivity for wandering is genetic. His phone numbers and e-mail address are ever-changing, and he can drive the people around him crazy with his elusiveness and his propensity to mask details about his life.Assange was born in 1971, in the city of Townsville, on Australia‚Äôs northeastern coast, but it is probably more accurate to say that he was born into a blur of domestic locomotion. Shortly after his first birthday, his mother‚ÄîI will call her Claire‚Äîmarried a theatre director, and the two collaborated on small productions. They moved often, living near Byron Bay, a beachfront community in New South Wales, and on Magnetic Island, a tiny pile of rock that Captain Cook believed had magnetic properties that distorted his compass readings. They were tough-minded nonconformists. (At seventeen, Claire had burned her schoolbooks and left home on a motorcycle.) Their house on Magnetic Island burned to the ground, and rifle cartridges that Claire had kept for shooting snakes exploded like fireworks. ‚ÄúMost of this period of my childhood was pretty Tom Sawyer,‚Äù Assange told me. ‚ÄúI had my own horse. I built my own raft. I went fishing. I was going down mine shafts and tunnels.‚Äù Assange‚Äôs mother believed that formal education would inculcate an unhealthy respect for authority in her children and dampen their will to learn. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want their spirits broken,‚Äù she told me. In any event, the family had moved thirty-seven times by the time Assange was fourteen, making consistent education impossible. He was homeschooled, sometimes, and he took correspondence classes and studied informally with university professors. But mostly he read on his own, voraciously. He was drawn to science. ‚ÄúI spent a lot of time in libraries going from one thing to another, looking closely at the books I found in citations, and followed that trail,‚Äù he recalled. He absorbed a large vocabulary, but only later did he learn how to pronounce all the words that he learned. When Assange was eight, Claire left her husband and began seeing a musician, with whom she had another child, a boy. The relationship was tempestuous; the musician became abusive, she says, and they separated. A fight ensued over the custody of Assange‚Äôs half brother, and Claire felt threatened, fearing that the musician would take away her son. Assange recalled her saying, ‚ÄúNow we need to disappear,‚Äù and he lived on the run with her from the age of eleven to sixteen. When I asked him about the experience, he told me that there was evidence that the man belonged to a powerful cult called the Family‚Äîits motto was ‚ÄúUnseen, Unknown, and Unheard.‚Äù Some members were doctors who persuaded mothers to give up their newborn children to the cult‚Äôs leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne. The cult had moles in government, Assange suspected, who provided the musician with leads on Claire‚Äôs whereabouts. In fact, Claire often told friends where she had gone, or hid in places where she had lived before. While on the run, Claire rented a house across the street from an electronics shop. Assange would go there to write programs on a Commodore 64, until Claire bought it for him, moving to a cheaper place to raise the money. He was soon able to crack into well-known programs, where he found hidden messages left by their creators. ‚ÄúThe austerity of one‚Äôs interaction with a computer is something that appealed to me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is like chess‚Äîchess is very austere, in that you don‚Äôt have many rules, there is no randomness, and the problem is very hard.‚Äù Assange embraced life as an outsider. He later wrote of himself and a teen-age friend, ‚ÄúWe were bright sensitive kids who didn‚Äôt fit into the dominant subculture and fiercely castigated those who did as irredeemable boneheads.‚ÄùWhen Assange turned sixteen, he got a modem, and his computer was transformed into a portal. Web sites did not exist yet‚Äîthis was 1987‚Äîbut computer networks and telecom systems were sufficiently linked to form a hidden electronic landscape that teen-agers with the requisite technical savvy could traverse. Assange called himself Mendax‚Äîfrom Horace‚Äôs splendide mendax, or ‚Äúnobly untruthful‚Äù‚Äîand he established a reputation as a sophisticated programmer who could break into the most secure networks. He joined with two hackers to form a group that became known as the International Subversives, and they broke into computer systems in Europe and North America, including networks belonging to the U.S. Department of Defense and to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In a book called ‚ÄúUnderground,‚Äù which he collaborated on with a writer named Suelette Dreyfus, he outlined the hacker subculture‚Äôs early Golden Rules: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt damage computer systems you break into (including crashing them); don‚Äôt change the information in those systems (except for altering logs to cover your tracks); and share information.‚Äù Around this time, Assange fell in love with a sixteen-year-old girl, and he briefly moved out of his mother‚Äôs home to stay with her. ‚ÄúA couple of days later, police turned up, and they carted off all my computer stuff,‚Äù he recalled. The raid, he said, was carried out by the state police, and ‚Äúit involved some dodgy character who was alleging that we had stolen five hundred thousand dollars from Citibank.‚Äù Assange wasn‚Äôt charged, and his equipment was returned. ‚ÄúAt that point, I decided that it might be wise to be a bit more discreet,‚Äù he said. Assange and the girl joined a squatters‚Äô union in Melbourne, until they learned she was pregnant, and moved to be near Claire. When Assange was eighteen, the two got married in an unofficial ceremony, and soon afterward they had a son. Hacking remained a constant in his life, and the thrill of digital exploration was amplified by the growing knowledge, among the International Subversives, that the authorities were interested in their activities. The Australian Federal Police had set up an investigation into the group, called Operation Weather, which the hackers strove to monitor. In September, 1991, when Assange was twenty, he hacked into the master terminal that Nortel, the Canadian telecom company, maintained in Melbourne, and began to poke around. The International Subversives had been visiting the master terminal frequently. Normally, Assange hacked into computer systems at night, when they were semi-dormant, but this time a Nortel administrator was signed on. Sensing that he might be caught, Assange approached him with humor. ‚ÄúI have taken control,‚Äù he wrote, without giving his name. ‚ÄúFor years, I have been struggling in this grayness. But now I have finally seen the light.‚Äù The administrator did not reply, and Assange sent another message: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been nice playing with your system. We didn‚Äôt do any damage and we even improved a few things. Please don‚Äôt call the Australian Federal Police.‚Äù The International Subversives‚Äô incursions into Nortel turned out to be a critical development for Operation Weather. Federal investigators tapped phone lines to see which ones the hackers were using. ‚ÄúJulian was the most knowledgeable and the most secretive of the lot,‚Äù Ken Day, the lead investigator, told me. ‚ÄúHe had some altruistic motive. I think he acted on the belief that everyone should have access to everything.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnderground‚Äù describes Assange‚Äôs growing fear of arrest: ‚ÄúMendax dreamed of police raids all the time. He dreamed of footsteps crunching on the driveway gravel, of shadows in the pre-dawn darkness, of a gun-toting police squad bursting through his backdoor at 5 am.‚Äù Assange could relax only when he hid his disks in an apiary that he kept. By October, he was in a terrible state. His wife had left him, taking with her their infant son. His home was a mess. He barely ate or slept. On the night the police came, the twenty-ninth, he wired his phone through his stereo and listened to the busy signal until eleven-thirty, when Ken Day knocked on his door, and told him, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve been expecting me.‚Äù Assange was charged with thirty-one counts of hacking and related crimes. While awaiting trial, he fell into a depression, and briefly checked himself into a hospital. He tried to stay with his mother, but after a few days he took to sleeping in nearby parks. He lived and hiked among dense eucalyptus forests in the Dandenong Ranges National Park, which were thick with mosquitoes whose bites scarred his face. ‚ÄúYour inner voice quiets down,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúInternal dialogue is stimulated by a preparatory desire to speak, but it is not actually useful if there are no other people around.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sound too Buddhist. But your vision of yourself disappears.‚ÄùIt took more than three years for the authorities to bring the case against Assange and the other International Subversives to court. Day told me, ‚ÄúWe had just formed the computer-crimes team, and the government said, ‚ÄòYour charter is to establish a deterrent.‚Äô Well, to get a deterrent you have to prosecute people, and we achieved that with Julian and his group.‚Äù A computer-security team working for Nortel in Canada drafted an incident report alleging that the hacking had caused damage that would cost more than a hundred thousand dollars to repair. The chief prosecutor, describing Assange‚Äôs near-limitless access, told the court, ‚ÄúIt was God Almighty walking around doing what you like.‚ÄùAssange, facing a potential sentence of ten years in prison, found the state‚Äôs reaction confounding. He bought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe First Circle,‚Äù a novel about scientists and technicians forced into the Gulag, and read it three times. (‚ÄúHow close the parallels to my own adventures!‚Äù he later wrote.) He was convinced that ‚Äúlook/see‚Äù hacking was a victimless crime, and intended to fight the charges. But the other members of the group decided to co√∂perate. ‚ÄúWhen a judge says, ‚ÄòThe prisoner shall now rise,‚Äô and no one else in the room stands‚Äîthat is a test of character,‚Äù he told me. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges and six were dropped. But at his final sentencing the judge said, ‚ÄúThere is just no evidence that there was anything other than sort of intelligent inquisitiveness and the pleasure of being able to‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the expression‚Äîsurf through these various computers.‚Äù Assange‚Äôs only penalty was to pay the Australian state a small sum in damages. As the criminal case was unfolding, Assange and his mother were also waging a campaign to gain full custody of Assange‚Äôs son‚Äîa legal fight that was, in many ways, far more wrenching than his criminal defense. They were convinced that the boy‚Äôs mother and her new boyfriend posed a danger to the child, and they sought to restrict her rights. The state‚Äôs child-protection agency, Health and Community Services, disagreed. The specifics of the allegations are unclear; family-court records in Australia are kept anonymous. But in 1995 a parliamentary committee found that the agency maintained an ‚Äúunderlying philosophy of deflecting as many cases away from itself as possible.‚Äù When the agency decided that a child was living in a safe household, there was no way to immediately appeal its decision.The custody battle evolved into a bitter fight with the state. ‚ÄúWhat we saw was a great bureaucracy that was squashing people,‚Äù Claire told me. She and Assange, along with another activist, formed an organization called Parent Inquiry Into Child Protection. ‚ÄúWe used full-on activist methods,‚Äù Claire recalled. In meetings with Health and Community Services, ‚Äúwe would go in and tape-record them secretly.‚Äù The organization used the Australian Freedom of Information Act to obtain documents from Health and Community Services, and they distributed flyers to child-protection workers, encouraging them to come forward with inside information, for a ‚Äúcentral databank‚Äù that they were creating. ‚ÄúYou may remain anonymous if you wish,‚Äù one flyer stated. One protection worker leaked to the group an important internal manual. Assange told me, ‚ÄúWe had moles who were inside dissidents.‚ÄùIn 1999, after nearly three dozen legal hearings and appeals, Assange worked out a custody agreement with his wife. Claire told me, ‚ÄúWe had experienced very high levels of adrenaline, and I think that after it all finished I ended up with P.T.S.D. It was like coming back from a war. You just can‚Äôt interact with normal people to the same degree, and I am sure that Jules has some P.T.S.D. that is untreated.‚Äù Not long after the court cases, she said, Assange‚Äôs hair, which had been dark brown, became drained of all color.Assange was burned out. He motorcycled across Vietnam. He held various jobs, and even earned money as a computer-security consultant, supporting his son to the extent that he was able. He studied physics at the University of Melbourne. He thought that trying to decrypt the secret laws governing the universe would provide the intellectual stimulation and rush of hacking. It did not. In 2006, on a blog he had started, he wrote about a conference organized by the Australian Institute of Physics, ‚Äúwith 900 career physicists, the body of which were sniveling fearful conformists of woefully, woefully inferior character.‚Äù He had come to understand the defining human struggle not as left versus right, or faith versus reason, but as individual versus institution. As a student of Kafka, Koestler, and Solzhenitsyn, he believed that truth, creativity, love, and compassion are corrupted by institutional hierarchies, and by ‚Äúpatronage networks‚Äù‚Äîone of his favorite expressions‚Äîthat contort the human spirit. He sketched out a manifesto of sorts, titled ‚ÄúConspiracy as Governance,‚Äù which sought to apply graph theory to politics. Assange wrote that illegitimate governance was by definition conspiratorial‚Äîthe product of functionaries in ‚Äúcollaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of a population.‚Äù He argued that, when a regime‚Äôs lines of internal communication are disrupted, the information flow among conspirators must dwindle, and that, as the flow approaches zero, the conspiracy dissolves. Leaks were an instrument of information warfare.These ideas soon evolved into WikiLeaks. In 2006, Assange barricaded himself in a house near the university and began to work. In fits of creativity, he would write out flow diagrams for the system on the walls and doors, so as not to forget them. There was a bed in the kitchen, and he invited backpackers passing through campus to stay with him, in exchange for help building the site. ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt sleep at all,‚Äù a person who was living in the house told me. ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt eat.‚Äù As it now functions, the Web site is primarily hosted on a Swedish Internet service provider called PRQ.se, which was created to withstand both legal pressure and cyber attacks, and which fiercely preserves the anonymity of its clients. Submissions are routed first through PRQ, then to a WikiLeaks server in Belgium, and then on to ‚Äúanother country that has some beneficial laws,‚Äù Assange told me, where they are removed at ‚Äúend-point machines‚Äù and stored elsewhere. These machines are maintained by exceptionally secretive engineers, the high priesthood of WikiLeaks. One of them, who would speak only by encrypted chat, told me that Assange and the other public members of WikiLeaks ‚Äúdo not have access to certain parts of the system as a measure to protect them and us.‚Äù The entire pipeline, along with the submissions moving through it, is encrypted, and the traffic is kept anonymous by means of a modified version of the Tor network, which sends Internet traffic through ‚Äúvirtual tunnels‚Äù that are extremely private. Moreover, at any given time WikiLeaks computers are feeding hundreds of thousands of fake submissions through these tunnels, obscuring the real documents. Assange told me that there are still vulnerabilities, but ‚Äúthis is vastly more secure than any banking network.‚ÄùBefore launching the site, Assange needed to show potential contributors that it was viable. One of the WikiLeaks activists owned a server that was being used as a node for the Tor network. Millions of secret transmissions passed through it. The activist noticed that hackers from China were using the network to gather foreign governments‚Äô information, and began to record this traffic. Only a small fraction has ever been posted on WikiLeaks, but the initial tranche served as the site‚Äôs foundation, and Assange was able to say, ‚ÄúWe have received over one million documents from thirteen countries.‚Äù In December, 2006, WikiLeaks posted its first document: a ‚Äúsecret decision,‚Äù signed by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, a Somali rebel leader for the Islamic Courts Union, that had been culled from traffic passing through the Tor network to China. The document called for the execution of government officials by hiring ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù as hit men. Assange and the others were uncertain of its authenticity, but they thought that readers, using Wikipedia-like features of the site, would help analyze it. They published the decision with a lengthy commentary, which asked, ‚ÄúIs it a bold manifesto by a flamboyant Islamic militant with links to Bin Laden? Or is it a clever smear by US intelligence, designed to discredit the Union, fracture Somali alliances and manipulate China?‚ÄùThe document‚Äôs authenticity was never determined, and news about WikiLeaks quickly superseded the leak itself. Several weeks later, Assange flew to Kenya for the World Social Forum, an anti-capitalist convention, to make a presentation about the Web site. ‚ÄúHe packed in the funniest way I have ever seen,‚Äù the person who had been living in the house recalled. ‚ÄúSomeone came to pick him up, and he was asked, ‚ÄòWhere is your luggage?‚Äô And he ran back into the house. He had a sailor‚Äôs sack, and he grabbed a whole bunch of stuff and threw it in there, mostly socks.‚Äù Assange ended up staying in Kenya for several months. He would check in with friends by phone and through the Internet from time to time, but was never precise about his movements. One friend told me, ‚ÄúIt would always be, ‚ÄòWhere is Julian?‚Äô It was always difficult to know where he was. It was almost like he was trying to hide.‚ÄùIt took about an hour on Easter morning to get from the house on Grettisgata Street to Iceland‚Äôs international airport, which is situated on a lava field by the sea. Assange, in the terminal, carried a threadbare blue backpack that contained hard drives, phone cards, and multiple cell phones. Gonggrijp had agreed to go to Washington to help with the press conference. He checked in, and the ticketing agent turned to Assange. ‚ÄúI am sorry,‚Äù she said to him. ‚ÄúI cannot find your name.‚Äù‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Assange said to Gonggrijp. ‚ÄúHave fun at the press conference.‚Äù‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Gonggrijp told the attendant. ‚ÄúWe have a booking I.D. number.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been confirmed,‚Äù Assange insisted.The attendant looked perplexed. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut my booking information has it ‚Äòcancelled.‚Äô ‚ÄúThe two men exchanged a look: was a government agency tampering with their plans? Assange waited anxiously, but it turned out that he had bought the ticket and neglected to confirm the purchase. He quickly bought another ticket, and the two men flew to New York and then rushed to catch the Acela to Washington. It was nearly two in the morning when they arrived. They got into a taxi, and Assange, who didn‚Äôt want to reveal the location of his hotel, told the driver to go to a nearby cross street. ‚ÄúHere we are in the lion‚Äôs den,‚Äù Gonggrijp said as the taxi raced down Massachusetts Avenue, passing rows of nondescript office buildings. Assange said, ‚ÄúNot looking too lionish.‚Äù A few hours after sunrise, Assange was standing at a lectern inside the National Press Club, ready to present ‚ÄúCollateral Murder‚Äù to the forty or so journalists who had come. He was dressed in a brown blazer, a black shirt, and a red tie. He played the film for the audience, pausing it to discuss various details. After the film ended, he ran footage of the Hellfire attack‚Äîa woman in the audience gasped as the first missile hit the building‚Äîand read from the e-mail sent by the Icelandic journalists who had gone to Iraq. The leak, he told the reporters, ‚Äúsends a message that some people within the military don‚Äôt like what is going on.‚ÄùThe video, in both raw and edited forms, was released on the site that WikiLeaks had built for it, and also on YouTube and a number of other Web sites. Within minutes after the press conference, Assange was invited to Al Jazeera‚Äôs Washington headquarters, where he spent half the day giving interviews, and that evening MSNBC ran a long segment about the footage. The video was covered in the Times, in multiple stories, and in every other major paper. On YouTube alone, more than seven million viewers have watched ‚ÄúCollateral Murder.‚Äù Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked about the footage, and said, clearly irritated, ‚ÄúThese people can put anything out they want and are never held accountable for it.‚Äù The video was like looking at war ‚Äúthrough a soda straw,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is no before and there is no after.‚Äù Army spokespeople insisted that there was no violation of the rules of engagement. At first, the media‚Äôs response hewed to Assange‚Äôs interpretation, but, in the ensuing days, as more commentators weighed in and the military offered its view, Assange grew frustrated. Much of the coverage focussed not on the Hellfire attack or the van but on the killing of the journalists and on how a soldier might reasonably mistake a camera for an RPG. On Twitter, Assange accused Gates of being ‚Äúa liar,‚Äù and beseeched members of the media to ‚Äústop spinning.‚Äù In some respects, Assange appeared to be most annoyed by the journalistic process itself‚Äî‚Äúa craven sucking up to official sources to imbue the eventual story with some kind of official basis,‚Äù as he once put it. WikiLeaks has long maintained a complicated relationship with conventional journalism. When, in 2008, the site was sued after publishing confidential documents from a Swiss bank, the Los Angeles Times, the Associated Press, and ten other news organizations filed amicus briefs in support. (The bank later withdrew its suit.) But, in the Bunker one evening, Gonggrijp told me, ‚ÄúWe are not the press.‚Äù He considers WikiLeaks an advocacy group for sources; within the framework of the Web site, he said, ‚Äúthe source is no longer dependent on finding a journalist who may or may not do something good with his document.‚ÄùAssange, despite his claims to scientific journalism, emphasized to me that his mission is to expose injustice, not to provide an even-handed record of events. In an invitation to potential collaborators in 2006, he wrote, ‚ÄúOur primary targets are those highly oppressive regimes in China, Russia and Central Eurasia, but we also expect to be of assistance to those in the West who wish to reveal illegal or immoral behavior in their own governments and corporations.‚Äù He has argued that a ‚Äúsocial movement‚Äù to expose secrets could ‚Äúbring down many administrations that rely on concealing reality‚Äîincluding the US administration.‚Äù Assange does not recognize the limits that traditional publishers do. Recently, he posted military documents that included the Social Security numbers of soldiers, and in the Bunker I asked him if WikiLeaks‚Äô mission would have been compromised if he had redacted these small bits. He said that some leaks risked harming innocent people‚Äî‚Äúcollateral damage, if you will‚Äù‚Äîbut that he could not weigh the importance of every detail in every document. Perhaps the Social Security numbers would one day be important to researchers investigating wrongdoing, he said; by releasing the information he would allow judgment to occur in the open. A year and a half ago, WikiLeaks published the results of an Army test, conducted in 2004, of electromagnetic devices designed to prevent IEDs from being triggered. The document revealed key aspects of how the devices functioned and also showed that they interfered with communication systems used by soldiers‚Äîinformation that an insurgent could exploit. By the time WikiLeaks published the study, the Army had begun to deploy newer technology, but some soldiers were still using the devices. I asked Assange if he would refrain from releasing information that he knew might get someone killed. He said that he had instituted a ‚Äúharm-minimization policy,‚Äù whereby people named in certain documents were contacted before publication, to warn them, but that there were also instances where the members of WikiLeaks might get ‚Äúblood on our hands.‚Äù One member told me that Assange‚Äôs editorial policy initially made her uncomfortable, but that she has come around to his position, because she believes that no one has been unjustly harmed. Of course, such harm is not always easy to measure. When Assange was looking for board members, he contacted Steven Aftergood, who runs an e-mail newsletter for the Federation of American Scientists, and who publishes sensitive documents. Aftergood declined to participate. ‚ÄúWhen a technical record is both sensitive and remote from a current subject of controversy, my editorial inclination is to err on the side of caution,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI miss that kind of questioning on their part.‚Äù At the same time, Aftergood told me, the overclassification of information is a problem of increasing scale‚Äîone that harms not only citizens, who should be able to have access to government records, but the system of classification itself. When too many secrets are kept, it becomes difficult to know which ones are important. Had the military released the video from the Apache to Reuters under FOIA, it would probably not have become a film titled ‚ÄúCollateral Murder,‚Äù and a public-relations nightmare. Lieutenant Colonel Lee Packnett, the spokesperson for intelligence matters for the Army, was deeply agitated when I called him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to give validity to WikiLeaks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not doing anything for the Army by putting us in a conversation about WikiLeaks. You can talk to someone else. It‚Äôs not an Army issue.‚Äù As he saw it, once ‚ÄúCollateral Murder‚Äù had passed through the news cycle, the broader counter-intelligence problem that WikiLeaks poses to the military had disappeared as well. ‚ÄúIt went away,‚Äù he said. With the release of ‚ÄúCollateral Murder,‚Äù WikiLeaks received more than two hundred thousand dollars in donations, and on April 7th Assange wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúNew funding model for journalism: try doing it for a change.‚Äù Just this winter, he had put the site into a state of semi-dormancy because there was not enough money to run it, and because its technical engineering needed adjusting. Assange has far more material than he can process, and he is seeking specialists who can sift through the chaotic WikiLeaks library and assign documents to volunteers for analysis. The donations meant that WikiLeaks would now be able to pay some volunteers, and in late May its full archive went back online. Still, the site remains a project in early development. Assange has been searching for the right way not only to manage it but also to get readers interested in the more arcane material there. In 2007, he published thousands of pages of secret military information detailing a vast number of Army procurements in Iraq and Afghanistan. He and a volunteer spent weeks building a searchable database, studying the Army‚Äôs purchasing codes, and adding up the cost of the procurements‚Äîbillions of dollars in all. The database catalogued mat√©riel that every unit had ordered: machine guns, Humvees, cash-counting machines, satellite phones. Assange hoped that journalists would pore through it, but barely any did. ‚ÄúI am so angry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis was such a fucking fantastic leak: the Army‚Äôs force structure of Afghanistan and Iraq, down to the last chair, and nothing.‚Äù WikiLeaks is a finalist for a Knight Foundation grant of more than half a million dollars. The intended project would set up a way for sources to pass documents to newspaper reporters securely; WikiLeaks would serve as a kind of numbered Swiss bank account, where information could be anonymously exchanged. (The system would allow the source to impose a deadline on the reporter, after which the document would automatically appear on WikiLeaks.) Assange has been experimenting with other ideas, too. On the principle that people won‚Äôt regard something as valuable unless they pay for it, he has tried selling documents at auction to news organizations; in 2008, he attempted this with seven thousand internal e-mails from the account of a former speechwriter for Hugo Ch√°vez. The auction failed. He is thinking about setting up a subscription service, where high-paying members would have early access to leaks.But experimenting with the site‚Äôs presentation and its technical operations will not answer a deeper question that WikiLeaks must address: What is it about? The Web site‚Äôs strengths‚Äîits near-total imperviousness to lawsuits and government harassment‚Äîmake it an instrument for good in societies where the laws are unjust. But, unlike authoritarian regimes, democratic governments hold secrets largely because citizens agree that they should, in order to protect legitimate policy. In liberal societies, the site‚Äôs strengths are its weaknesses. Lawsuits, if they are fair, are a form of deterrence against abuse. Soon enough, Assange must confront the paradox of his creation: the thing that he seems to detest most‚Äîpower without accountability‚Äîis encoded in the site‚Äôs DNA, and will only become more pronounced as WikiLeaks evolves into a real institution. After the press conference in Washington, I met Assange in New York, in Bryant Park. He had brought his luggage with him, because he was moving between the apartments of friends of friends. We sat near the fountain, and drank coffee. That week, Assange was scheduled to fly to Berkeley, and then to Italy, but back in Iceland the volcano was erupting again, and his flight to Europe was likely to change. He looked a bit shell-shocked. ‚ÄúIt was surprising to me that we were seen as such an impartial arbiter of the truth, which may speak well to what we have done,‚Äù he told me. But he also said, ‚ÄúTo be completely impartial is to be an idiot. This would mean that we would have to treat the dust in the street the same as the lives of people who have been killed.‚Äù A number of commentators had wondered whether the video‚Äôs title was manipulative. ‚ÄúIn hindsight, should we have called it ‚ÄòPermission to Engage‚Äô rather than ‚ÄòCollateral Murder‚Äô?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still not sure.‚Äù He was annoyed by Gates‚Äôs comment on the film: ‚ÄúHe says, ‚ÄòThere is no before and no after.‚Äô Well, at least there is now a middle, which is a vast improvement.‚Äù Then Assange leaned forward and, in a whisper, began to talk about a leak, code-named Project G, that he is developing in another secret location. He promised that it would be news, and I saw in him the same mixture of seriousness and amusement, devilishness and intensity that he had displayed in the Bunker. ‚ÄúIf it feels a little bit like we‚Äôre amateurs, it is because we are,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone is an amateur in this business.‚Äù And then, his coffee finished, he made his way out of the park and into Times Square, disappearing among the masses of people moving this way and that.¬†‚ô¶Raffi Khatchadourian became a staff writer at The New Yorker in 2008.

204,5148648,Top 5 Skills Every Leader Must Have,http://www.inc.com/steve-tobak/5-leadership-skills-you-must-have.html,2013,"A few years ago, I saw a video by a Harvard professor on competences for adapting to a changing world. Frankly, it was embarrassing. It was the biggest load of pseudo-intellectual garbage I‚Äôd ever heard.¬†Still, the world is changing.¬†It‚Äôs becoming a more complex place. I guess that‚Äôs always been the case, but the rate of change appears to be accelerating. Given that‚Äôs the case, then what are the real capabilities will people need to distinguish themselves--to become the leaders, the innovators, the success stories of a new age?Fortunately, as a veteran of the high-tech industry, I‚Äôve known and worked with some of the most capable and accomplished folks around. Here are five competences that not only set them apart, but are becoming more and more important all the time.¬†No, they‚Äôre not new-age business school jargon. Some aren‚Äôt even new. But what‚Äôs important is that they work.¬†1. Drown out the noise.We live and work in a world that‚Äôs so overloaded with information, communication, and gadgets that fighting that irresistible and constant tug to text, tweet, and check our email is becoming harder and harder all the time. That trend is not likely to change anytime soon.Ability to focus and prioritize has always been critical to success in just about any field, but these days, managing distraction and not succumbing to its addictive qualities has become remarkably challenging for even the most disciplined among us.Make no mistake. If you can‚Äôt focus, you can‚Äôt get things done. And if you can‚Äôt get things done, somebody else will.2. Recognize the bullsh*t.When you question assumptions, claims, and viewpoints instead of just accepting them as gospel, as in ""I saw it on the internet so it must be true,"" that's called critical thinking. It‚Äôs fundamental for smart decision-making. And that, in turn, is key to being successful at just about anything.The concept dates back thousands of years to Socrates and Buddha's teachings. If you question conventional wisdom, challenge the status quo, and avoid collectivism and groupthink, you‚Äôre in good company. They‚Äôre all facets of the same concept. ¬†Here‚Äôs the thing. There‚Äôs so much garbage out there in the cloud, in social media, in blogs, on TV, in self-help books -- you name it -- that your ability to question what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt, to reason logically and not generalize from a single data point, is more critical today than ever before.And, in time, the world is only going to become more and more complex and, that‚Äôs right, full of stuff. ¬†¬†3. Be more than an avatar.¬†It‚Äôs ironic that, with all the hoopla over personal branding, self-expression, and the ‚ÄúMe‚Äù generation, I find that people are becoming more and more like internet avatars every day. In other words, there‚Äôs a tendency to hide behind our own social media creations. To become sound bites personified.More than ever, we need a sense of humility and self-awareness to remind us that we're flesh and blood humans. That we‚Äôre not always the insanely great business leaders, managers, entrepreneurs, partners, parents, whatever, that we hold ourselves out to be.Not only that, but the sheer volume of noise and time we waste on mindless distraction makes it that much harder to stay in touch with ourselves, to be quiet and reflect on what‚Äôs going on inside, to understand what our emotions are trying to tell us. ¬†And don‚Äôt even get me started on political correctness, that insidious worldwide trend that dumbs us all down to the lowest common denominator so no single individual is ever left out or made to feel uncomfortable or, God forbid, offended.In a world of indistinguishable lemmings, where everyone tries to be different and, in so doing, ends up behaving exactly like everyone else, those who are genuine and self-aware will have a big advantage.4. Truly connect with people.Communication has always been the means by which great leaders achieve great things. But these days, communication occurs in sound bites, status updates, text messages, and tweets of 140 characters or less. More and more, communication is one-to-many, not one-to-one.The problem with that is it‚Äôs mostly superficial and nobody‚Äôs got time to pay attention to even a tiny fraction of all the gigabytes being blasted at them every day.As for all the online social networking we do, none of it‚Äôs even fractionally effective when compared with a simple real-time discussion or meeting.Sure, the ability to write and speak effectively is perhaps more important today than ever before. But if you have that unique ability to listen and really hear what people are saying, to empathize, to really relate and truly connect with folks, then chances are you‚Äôll be writing tomorrow‚Äôs success stories.5. Get things done.The idea that successful executives, entrepreneurs, and business leaders are typically driven by high aspirations is nothing but a popular myth. Most of those people didn't get to where they are by walking around with their heads in the clouds. They got there by putting one foot in front of the other and getting stuff done.If they‚Äôre not motivated by grandiose dreams, then what does drive successful people? It‚Äôs usually one of three things: their job and a strong sense of personal responsibility, out of necessity to put food on the table and a roof over their family‚Äôs heads, or to bring a product to market they think is cool and that people might actually want or need.Regardless of the reason, they get people working toward a common goal. They deliver the goods. They get the job done. They satisfy the needs of their customers. And in so doing, they take care of their families and stakeholders. That‚Äôs how things work in the real world.These days we have more rhetoric, debate, analysis, studies, theories and research than ever before. We have more grandiose ideals than ever before. We have more rules and regulations than ever before. The challenge to get things done has never been greater and the need for leaders with that capability has never been more imperative.That‚Äôs what I think you and your children will need to adapt to a changing world. Now, what do you think?¬†¬†"

206,6604333,Randi Zuckerberg: Post More Baby Photos,http://ideas.time.com/2013/10/23/randi-zuckerberg-post-more-baby-photos/,2013,"It‚Äôs time to stop pretending we can separate our personal life from our work life Follow @TIMEIdeasAs the sister of Facebook‚Äôs founder, I‚Äôve seen people over the years delight in finding bits of my life that have surfaced online and giving them undue attention. Some bachelorette party photos here, a video of me singing there‚Äîthe attention is understandable. But it‚Äôs exhausting to put on an act‚Äîto be somebody in one situation and somebody else in another. So a long time ago, I decided to stop being afraid to share.This philosophy was put to the test when I had my son Asher two years ago. Even though I promised myself that when he was born, I wouldn‚Äôt become ‚Äúthat mom‚Äù on Facebook, I fell hard off the wagon. First yawn? Adorbs. Facebook it. First hiccups? Obviously all my friends want to see that. Snoozing in a park? OMG, soooo cute! Who wouldn‚Äôt want to see baby photos 50 times a day?I soon found out. I had some pretty honest co-workers, and one day one of them decided to give it to me straight. ‚ÄúRandi,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúAsher is adorable, but you can‚Äôt keep posting a zillion baby photos. You have a professional reputation to uphold.‚ÄùUltimately, though, I came to the conclusion that the people who think we need to create a purely professional, one-dimensional brand online have got it totally wrong.Hear me out.Right now, there are two generations in the workforce who think in diametrically opposite ways about identity. Executives who came of age in the pre-smartphone era take it as a given that you should have a separate professional persona that reads like a profile in Forbes and doesn‚Äôt overlap with your personal life.But my generation came of age in a world with social networks, and we know that we don‚Äôt have that luxury anymore. We understand that the business leaders of the future will be three-dimensional¬≠ personalities whose lives, interests, hobbies and passions outside of work are documented and on display.We should embrace this new world. The answer isn‚Äôt fewer baby pictures; it‚Äôs more baby pictures. It‚Äôs not that I should post less; it‚Äôs that everyone else should post more.Let‚Äôs change what it means to be professional in the Internet age. The time when your personal identity was a secret to your colleagues is over and done. And that is a good thing.If anything, being my authentic self online makes me a better leader at work. Research has shown that when you refuse to share personal details on Facebook with your colleagues, it reduces your likability in the office compared with that of people who share. A forthcoming white paper by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School shows that people who shared personal information with their work colleagues and ¬≠bosses‚Äîand seamlessly blended their off-line and online lives‚Äîwere thought of as better workers.Since we‚Äôre all going to be exposing more about ourselves online in our careers, we need to start being a bit more tolerant of what we learn about our colleagues and professional contacts. Employees are people too, and most (or at least some) of their lives are spent outside the office. As the distinction between public and private behavior changes, so should our expectations of one another.We also need to be sure that we respect one another‚Äôs tech-life balance. Given that your work colleagues will also be your friends on social media, there could come a time when you are still waiting for a response from them relating to a work matter and see that they have had time to post something on Instagram or make a move in Words With Friends. At these times, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that everyone has a life outside of work‚Äîand we‚Äôre all entitled to it.This also applies in the world of our friends. With texting, in particular, it feels as if we should get a response instantaneously. But demanding an instant reply to your messages is like tapping someone on the shoulder and interrupting a conversation they‚Äôre having with someone else.When you maintain a single identity online and grant the same to your co-workers, you not only become better regarded and more trustworthy at work, but you also become more productive.
Plus, who doesn‚Äôt like baby photos of kids on vacation? There‚Äôs nothing more adorable than watching little Asher try to walk in the sand. I think I have a picture of it somewhere. Zuckerberg is the CEO and founder of Zuckerberg Media and author of Dot Complicated: Untangling Our Wired Lives (HarperCollins Publishers, 2013), from which this is adapted.It won‚Äôt be easy to pay for reducing greenhouse gas emissions when we won‚Äôt be the primary beneficiariesIt‚Äôs clear that a reasonable person will not expect very much privacy regarding personal information in the futureQuite a number of women know better than to take parental responsibilities they‚Äôre not up to.Send us your lettersSend a letter to the editor here.

In the past decade we have seen a revolution in computing that transcends anything   seen to date in terms of scope and reach, but also in terms of how we think   about what makes up ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù computing. The   Web taught us several unintuitive lessons: 1. Simple, relaxed, sloppily extensible text formats and protocols   often work better than complex and efficient binary ones. Because there   are no barriers to entry, these are ideal. A bottom-up initiative can quickly   form around them and reach a tipping point in terms of adoption. In other words,   anyone can write HTML, no matter how syntax-challenged they may be, because   the browsers are so forgiving; and even writing an HTTP server is within the   reach of orders of magnitude more than, say, writing a CORBA or DCOM server.   What‚Äôs more, if the text format doesn‚Äôt work, one can easily mail   around the HTTP request or HTML to friends who will examine it in their text   tool of choice and explain what is incorrect. In short, having a format that   ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people can inspect, understand, augment, and author is   hugely important to adoption in a bottom-up world. 2. It is worth making things simple enough that one can harness Moore‚Äôs   law in parallel. This means that a system can scale more or less linearly   both to handle the volume of the requests coming in and, ideally, to handle   the complexity. For example, Google is able to handle huge numbers of requests   that ask for quite complex work (find all the documents out of billions that   are ‚Äúmost relevant‚Äù to the following words) largely because it can   scale linearly with respect to both the size of the underlying corpus and the   volume of queries. DNS is, of course, the best example of this, but so is caching,   which brings me to point 3. 3. It is acceptable to be stale much of the time. Most data   isn‚Äôt updated frequently, if at all. It is inserted as a new version (because   of audit trail issues, etc.). Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter if what you   see is a bit out of date. For example, if one uses the tracker for FedEx to   look for a package and the data it shows is 30 minutes out of date, it will   hardly be catastrophic. Unless one runs too fine a line on meetings or catching   flights, even an airline‚Äôs landing info may be two to three minutes out   of date without any serious ramifications. This fact inherently enables scalability   by enabling the lazy copying of data to extra disks. 4. The wisdom of crowds works amazingly well. Successful   systems on the Web are bottom-up. They don‚Äôt mandate much in a top-down   way. Instead, they control themselves through tipping points. For example, Flickr   doesn‚Äôt tell its users what tags to use for photos. Far from it. Any user   can tag any photo with anything (well, I don‚Äôt think you can use spaces).   But, and this is a key but, Flickr does provide feedback about the most popular   tags, and people seeking attention for their photos, or photos that they like,   quickly learn to use that lexicon if it makes sense. It turns out to be amazingly   stable. Del.icio.us does the same for links (and did it first, actually). Google‚Äôs   success in making a more relevant search was based on leveraging the wisdom   of crowds (PageRank). RSS 2.0 is taking off because there is a critical mass   of people reading it and it is easy to read/write, so people have decided to   leverage that when publishing content. It isn‚Äôt that it is a good or bad   format for things other than syndicated content (for which I think it is very   good). Rather, it works well enough. 5. People understand a graph composed of tree-like documents (HTML)   related by links (URLs). In some ways I find this the most surprising   of all. For years we assumed people had trouble with trees, never mind graphs.   And suddenly hyperlinks come along, and as long as there is a Back button, they   work.   There were some unsurprising lessons to be relearned as well:  6. Pay attention to physics. As a simple rule of thumb, an   individual server can normally handle perhaps 100 requests a second (I‚Äôll   say within one order of magnitude up if simple ones and down if very hard ones).   If the goal is for each server to support 1,000 concurrent users, therefore,   try to avoid an event model in which each user pings the server more than once   per 10 seconds, let alone one. In short, avoid a fine-grained model of code   on the server responding to events at the level of mouse moves or keys typed   or each time the scrollbar is dragged three millimeters because if you do, you‚Äôll   be generating about 10 events per second or two orders of magnitude too many.   By the way, even if supporting only 10 concurrent users per server is acceptable,   communications are often fragile, and it isn‚Äôt a great idea to be extremely   fine-grained because a small rare glitch in communications can much more easily   break the system. 7. Be as loosely coupled as possible. Ideally, the server   runs asynchronously with respect to the client. They are loosely coupled with   respect to time. Then it is easy to maximize overall server throughput and handle   prioritization of requests and failover. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt widely   practiced because of the nature of most of today‚Äôs applications frameworks,   which do not make asynchrony easy enough for mere mortal programmers, and because   the one thing about which asynchrony is unreliable is guaranteed latency, which   is essential to a good user experience. The frameworks were derived to support   killer apps, which were all about user interface. Failing asynchrony, then at   least have a model in which there isn‚Äôt a hard link (meaning an IP link)   between the client and the server because load and code on servers are always   altering and machines do fail. So always go through indirection on the way to   the server. URLs and redirects both obviously serve this purpose and, between   them, do it very well. Some people swizzle at the DNS level and others at the   redirect level, but both let one handle moving load and code around, even at   runtime. In either case, don‚Äôt require shared secrets, let alone shared   code, to make things work. For example, the browser will continue to work with   a site even if the code at the site is completely replaced and the language   switched and the operating system switched. There is a limit to this. HTTP and   HTML are shared secrets between the browser and the server, so perhaps the rule   should be to have incredibly few of them and make them incredibly simple, flexible,   forgiving, and generic.  8. KISS. Keep it (the design) simple and stupid. Complex   systems tend to fail. They are hard to tune. They tend not to scale as well.   They require smarter people to keep the wheels on the road. In short, they are   a pain in the you-know-what. Conversely, simple systems tend to be easy to tune   and debug and tend to fail less and scale better and are usually easier to operate.   This isn‚Äôt news. As I‚Äôve argued before, spreadsheets and SQL and   PHP all succeeded precisely because they are simple and stupid‚Äîand forgiving.   Interestingly, standards bodies tend to keep working on standards long after   they should have been frozen. They forget these lessons and add a million bells   and whistles that would, if adopted, undoubtedly cause the systems to fail.   Luckily this doesn‚Äôt happen because by then there is a large body of installed   code (and even hardware) out there that assumes the simpler spec and cannot   handle the new bells and whistles. Therefore, no one uses them and we are all   protected.  Some of us learned these lessons seven or eight years ago and applied them to   distributed computing. We had the explicit goal of using XML over HTTP to exchange   information between applications via messages to build a loosely coupled, robust,   Web-friendly model for distributed computing. In my humble opinion, however,   we ignored or forgot lessons 3, 4, and 5.  Lesson 3 tells us that elements in XML with values that are unlikely to change   for some known period of time (or where it is acceptable that they are stale   for that period of time, such as the title of a book) should be marked to say   this. XML has no such model. You can use the HTTP protocol to say this in a   very coarse way, but, for example, a book may mostly be invariant, though occasionally   have a price change or a new comment, and certainly an item up for auction may   see the price change.   Lesson 4 says that we shouldn‚Äôt over-invest in making schemas universally   understood. Certain ones will win when they hit critical mass (as RSS 2.0 has   done), and others will not. Some will support several variant but successful   strains (as RSS has also done where most readers can read RSS .92, RSS 1.0,   RSS 2.0, and Atom). It also suggests that trying to mandate universal URLs for   semantics is unlikely to work because, in general, they will not reach a critical   mass, and thus people will not know about them‚Äînever mind take the trouble   to use them. In short, if a large number of people aren‚Äôt using something   or there isn‚Äôt a feedback mechanism to know what to use, then it will   not be used.   Lessons 1 and 5 tell us that XML should be easy to understand without schemas   and should let the clients intelligently decide how and when to fetch related   information, especially large files such as photos, videos, and music, but even   just related sets of XML such as comments on a post, reviews of a candidate,   or ratings for a restaurant.   Hmm. There are some interesting implications in all of this.   One is that the Semantic Web is in for a lot of heartbreak. It has been trying   for five years to convince the world to use it. It actually has a point. XML   is supposed to be self-describing so that loosely coupled works. If you require   a shared secret on both sides, then I‚Äôd argue the system isn‚Äôt loosely   coupled, even if the only shared secret is a schema. What‚Äôs more, XML   itself has three serious weaknesses in this regard: 1. It doesn‚Äôt handle binary data well. No sensible   person will encode large amounts of binary data into XML. But then no sensible   person would push binary data in the first place. They would let the receiver   get it using existing protocols for streaming in binary data (or maybe BitTorrent   these days). 2. It doesn‚Äôt handle links. The world is not one giant   tree that can be freeze-dried and put into text. You have to break it up into   chunks. And one man‚Äôs chunk is another man‚Äôs set of chunks. The   way to deal with this is self-describing links, which could, optionally, show   you the MIME type and/or purpose of the link as in <Link purpose=‚Äùcomments‚Äù   type=‚ÄùText/Atom‚Äù/> and/or a self-describing syntax for what the   server ‚Äúthinks‚Äù is chunks (see point 3 below).  If you examine XML, it typically is made up of sets of data and even sets of   sets of data. The problem is that one cannot look at XML (supposedly self-describing,   remember) and know which elements are instances of a set and which are not.   If one sees, for example:  one can‚Äôt safely assume that there is a set of <email> elements.   Now the schema will describe this but, it‚Äôs both hard (the XML schema   language is very complex) and, more to the point, requires a shared secret.   Ideally, this wouldn‚Äôt be required, and a tool, without constantly downloading   and analyzing schemas for each and every XML document, could easily figure this   out from the instance.  3. XML documents tend to be monolithic. Given a purchase   order, for example, and the desire to insert a line item or replace the address,   it is very hard to know how, since the items don‚Äôt contain IDs or the   date they were last created/updated. By contrast, the database world breaks   things down into rows, each of which typically has a unique ID and a date created,   although the last varies from database to database. This lets people ‚Äúchunk‚Äù   the information while they still have the ability to assemble it. By default   in XML, the order of child elements matters. This encourages errors, however.   It violates the rule of letting sloppy people author. A lot of XML errors are   simple differences in the order of child elements. In most cases (except documents   intended for printing) this does not and should not matter.  Recently, an opportunity has arisen to transcend these limitations. RSS 2.0   has become an extremely popular format on the Web. RSS 2.0 and Atom (which is   essentially isomorphic) both support a base schema that provides a model for   sets. Atom‚Äôs general model is a container (a <feed>) of <entry>   elements in which each <entry> may contain any namespace scoped elements   it chooses (thus any XML), must contain a small number of required elements   (<id>, <updated>, and <title>), and may contain some other   well-known ones in the Atom namespace such as <link>s.   Even better, Atom clearly says that the order doesn‚Äôt matter. This immediately   gives a simple model for sets missing in XML. All one has to do is create a   <feed> for a set and put each item in the set into an <entry>. Since   all <entry> elements contain an <id> (which is a GUID) and an <updated>   element (which is the date it was last altered), it is easy to define the semantics   of replacing specific entries and even confirm that you are replacing the ones   that you think (e.g., they have the same <id> and the same <updated>.   Since they have a title, it is easy to build a user interface to display menus   of them. Virtually all Atom entries have a <content> or <summary>   element (or both) that summarizes the value of the entry in a user-friendly   way and enhances the automatic user interface. If the entry has related binary   information such as pictures or sound, it contains <link> elements that   have attributes describing the MIME type and size of the target, thus letting   the consumer of an Atom feed make intelligent choices about which media to fetch   when and how, and resolving the outage XML has in this regard.   Atom also supports links of other sorts, such as comments, so clearly an Atom   entry can contain links to related feeds (e.g., Reviews for a Restaurant or   Complaints for a Customer) or links to specific posts. This gives us the network   and graph model that is missing in XML. Atom contains a simple HTTP-based way   to INSERT, DELETE, and REPLACE <entry>s within a <feed>. There is   a killer app for all these documents because the browsers already can view RSS   2.0 and Atom and, hopefully, will soon natively support the Atom protocol as   well, which would mean read and write capabilities.   RSS 2.0 has reached the tipping point where it is universally understood. Missing   from RSS is the time-to-live (TTL) indicator necessary for caching, but as discussed,   HTTP provides a coarse-grained model for this. In short, it may well be that   a lot of useful information is going to flow over the Web as either RSS 2.0   or Atom (or both, depending on the type the requester asks for). It addresses   many of the serious limitations or outages in XML today.   All of this has profound implications for databases. Today databases violate   essentially every lesson we have learned from the Web.  1. Are simple relaxed text formats and protocols supported?   No. We‚Äôre still in the CORBA world. One still requires custom code to   read a database. It is as though the browser required a driver to talk to each   site (or at least type of site). It makes no sense in this day and age, and,   as we have just seen, there is now a worthy candidate in Atom for a default   protocol that every database should support, and in both Atom and RSS 2.0 for   a wire format. 2. Have databases enabled people to harness Moore‚Äôs law in parallel?   This would mean that databases could scale more or less linearly to handle both   the volume of the requests coming in and even the complexity. The answer is   no. Things like ORDER BY, joins, subqueries, and many others make it almost   impossible to push the query logic down to an arbitrary number of leaf nodes   and simply sort/merge/aggregate the results. The easier way to limit queries   to avoid this would be to limit all predicates to ones that can be computed   against a single row at a time, at least where efficiency and scale are paramount. 3. Do databases optimize caching when it is OK to be stale?   No. Databases in general don‚Äôt have a way to mark what the TTL of fields   is and then typically don‚Äôt have a way in the query language to describe   the acceptable staleness. Thus, caching across a sea of machines, the other   best mechanism for speed, is rendered almost impossible. 4. Do databases let schemas evolve for a set of items using a bottom-up   consensus/tipping point? Obviously not. They typically are extremely   rigid about the schema. This is regarded as a feature. Do databases let users   ‚Äútag‚Äù data? Not at all easily because the point of tag rows would   be that the foreign key in each row might point at any other row in any table,   and relational databases don‚Äôt typically enable this.  5. Do databases handle flexible graphs (or trees) well? No,   they do not. It has long been known that walking an arbitrary tree is a nightmare   for databases. This is a big problem even today for many sites. While you can   model any link that is normative in a database, it is almost impossible to model   specific links to specific sets. In other words, I can have a WhoToGoTo field   be a foreign key into People, but not into People or Companies or Friends or   Helpdesks, or sometimes be a single value and sometimes a set and sometimes   a pointer to an HTML page. Today‚Äôs databases are to graphs as IMPROV was   to a spreadsheet‚Äînamely, much more formal, rigorous, and inflexible. The   spreadsheet turned out to be the more robust and useful tool. 6. Have the databases learned from the Web and made their queries   simple and flexible? No, just ask a database if it has anyone who,   if they have an age, are older than 40; and if they have a city, live in New   York; and if they have an income, earn more than $100,000. This is a nightmare   because of all the tests for NULL. There isn‚Äôt a simple effective standard   for the most basic query of all, which is ‚Äúabout‚Äù the following   words (e.g., tell me about everything: friends, people, employees, projects‚Ä¶).   Yet this is the type of query that is most forgiving, most flexible, and most   widely understood.   This is changing. Oracle has done a remarkable job of adding XML to its database   in the various ways that customers might want. In so doing, it has added a lot   of these capabilities. Its ROWID type allows some forms of flexible linkage.   But none really shows that they have learned from the Web.  Distributed computing has been learning and evolving in response to the lessons   of the Web. Formats and protocols are arising to overcome the limitations of   XML‚Äîeven as XML in turn arose to overcome the limitations of CORBA and   DCOM. It is time that the database vendors stepped up to the plate and started   to support a native RSS 2.0/Atom protocol and wire format; a simple way to ask   very general queries; a way to model data that encompasses trees and arbitrary   graphs in ways that humans think about them; far more fluid schemas that don‚Äôt   require complex joins to model variations on a theme about anything from products   to people to places; and built-in linear scaling so that the database salespeople   can tell their customers, in good conscience, for this class of queries you   can scale arbitrarily with regard to throughput and extremely well even with   regard to latency, as long as you limit yourself to the following types of queries.   Then we will know that the database vendors have joined the 21st century.  ADAM BOSWORTH joined Google in 2004 as vice president of engineering. He came   to Google from BEA Systems where he was chief architect and senior vice president   of advanced development, responsible for the engineering efforts for BEA‚Äôs   Framework Division. Prior to joining BEA, he co-founded Crossgain, a software   development firm acquired by BEA. Known as one of the pioneers of XML, Bosworth   held various senior management positions at Microsoft, including general manager   of the WebData group, a team focused on defining and driving XML strategy. While   at Microsoft, he was responsible for designing the Microsoft Access PC database   product and assembling and driving the team that developed Internet Explorer   4.0‚Äôs HTML engine.

Alon Halevy - Why Your Data Won't Mix

	  When independent parties develop database schemas for the same domain, they  will almost always be quite different from each other. These differences are  referred to as semantic heterogeneity, which also appears in the presence of  multiple XML documents, Web services, and ontologies‚Äîor more broadly,  whenever there is more than one way to structure a body of data. The presence  of semi-structured data exacerbates semantic heterogeneity, because semi-structured  schemas are much more flexible to start with. For multiple data systems to cooperate  with each other, they must understand each other‚Äôs schemas.
	  
Natalya Noy - Order from Chaos

	  There is probably little argument that the past decade has brought the ‚Äúbig  bang‚Äù in the amount of online information available for processing by  humans and machines. Two of the trends that it spurred (among many others) are:  first, there has been a move to more flexible and fluid (semi-structured) models  than the traditional centralized relational databases that stored most of the  electronic data before; second, today there is simply too much information available  to be processed by humans, and we really need help from machines.

            Nick Stamoulis
Links have always been and continue to be an extremely important part of SEO. Google ranks websites based on trust and the inbound links pointing to a website convey this trust. In the early days of Google and SEO nearly any link was considered to be a good link. That‚Äôs why so many low quality directories and link farms started popping up. Website owners knew that people were out hunting for links so they sold them. As the Google ranking algorithm has become much more advanced, these practices are now frowned upon. The link building focus has shifted to building links from relevant sites that target audience members actually visit. That way, the links help build SEO trust but also help to improve visibility and generate traffic back to the website.Google has been transparent about its views on link building and the quality of links. Website owners that have a significant amount of these spammy links pointing to their site may get penalized. Within Google Webmaster Tools, Google will alert site owners with a message about these ‚Äúunnatural links‚Äù pointing to the site. These links can be the result of not understanding the link ‚Äúrules‚Äù, hiring a black hat SEO firm, or even negative SEO. The reason behind the bad links doesn‚Äôt matter. All that matters are the steps that you take moving forward. It has always been best practice to go through your inbound link portfolio and take whatever steps necessary to remove these bad links. This involved reaching out to the webmaster of the source of the link (sometimes numerous times) to request removal. Sometimes these links were removed, other times they weren‚Äôt.For years webmasters have been requesting a way to alert Google to the fact that they are aware of the bad links and want to get rid of them. With the recent release of the new tool to disavow links, webmasters may finally have their wish. Within Google Webmaster Tools, site owners can now visit a page that allows them to upload a file containing the links that they want to disavow.While this may seem like the end of many headaches that webmasters have encountered, Google is warning site owners that it‚Äôs not a magic fix. In fact, they are even saying that it should only be used as a last resort. The first step is to continue to follow the manual process of getting links removed. If, and only if, you still can‚Äôt get them removed should you use the disavow tool. Google has also warned that this isn‚Äôt a tool to be used by the novice webmaster. A webmaster needs to be absolutely sure that a link isn‚Äôt any good before making the move to disavow it.According to Google, the vast majority of websites don‚Äôt need to use it. Every website is bound to have some bad links pointing to it over time. As long as the good far outweigh the bad, Google isn‚Äôt going to penalize you for it.Categorized in: Search Engines

‚ÄúWhen we began searching for an SEO service provider, our team had a limited understanding of what SEO entailed. After interviewing other SEO companies, it was clear from speaking with Nick that Brick Marketing does more than add keywords to your web content. By examining our tradeshow presence, blogging practices and online directory listings, Nick & Danielle have helped us work through company- and industry -specific obstacles to raise our SEO efforts to a new level. Keeping up with algorithm changes and industry trends, Brick Marketing is the perfect partner to ensure your SEO practices continue to be both white hat and impactful.‚Äù‚Äì Catie Moyer, Copywriter Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.‚ÄúI had been impressed for a long time with the content that Brick Marketing was sharing in their informative blog posts and articles. I chatted with Nick Stamoulis a couple times and decided that he was the expert I wanted to work with. I have worked with Brick Marketing for about six months and they have helped us resolve several SEO related issues pertaining to our website. Our account rep is always just an email away with answers to any questions I have and suggestions for how we can improve what we‚Äôre doing. Brick Marketing is ‚Äúsolid‚Äù when it comes to support for SEO marketing advice. I definitely recommend them if you want to feel more secure about how your website is performing in searches and have the confidence that everything being done to improve your rank is white hat and legit.‚Äù‚Äì Paul Rarick, Debbiegrattan.com‚ÄúWhen we came to Brick Marketing initially, we had a small subset of challenges we didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth to tackle in house. Our idea was simply to send out the work and be done with it. A one-shot deal. What we found mid way into the first project, was that Nick Stamoulis and Brick Marketing had a depth of understanding and approach to solving our Search Engine Marketing problems that we had not considered; solutions that dramatically improved our search engine ranking position on terms and improved the overall size of our index listing (by more than 25% in the first two months). In short order we expanded our horizons and enlisted his talents to take on refining and improving ROI on our rather expensive Pay Per Click campaigns, as well as having him consult on microsite projects and blogs. Nick Stamoulis of Brick Marketing helped us understand what works and why, and helping us maintain our dominant position in the SERPs, despite the markets constant resetting and ever-changing drama. I could not have gotten through this year without Brick Marketing‚Äôs assistance and advice. I couldn‚Äôt give a stronger recommendation; they are simply great!‚Äù‚Äì Connie Childrey, DataDirect Technologies‚ÄúBrick Marketing impressed us from the get-go with their enthusiasm, know-how and commitment to upstanding SEO techniques. They were communicative, responsive and transparent throughout, detailing an extensive game plan and delivering on every count. Thanks to effective collaboration and their meticulous methodology, our website‚Äôs manual penalty action was successfully revoked.‚Äù‚Äì Laura J Lowe, Marketing Manager EMDAT‚ÄúWe implemented all the valuable suggestions and together we definitely saw amazing results over time. Other SEO companies may leave you in the dark but Brick Marketing kept us in the loop during the entire time, educating us about ALL the strategies being used that helped propel us forward organically.‚Äù‚Äì Maura Statman, Everyone Loves Buttons Inc. ¬Æ‚ÄúBrick Marketing is a no nonsense SEO company focused on getting you results. I really appreciate their patience, insight and going the extra mile to help Gold Lasso better understand the intricacies of the SEO discpline and how we can be more successful with our SEO programs. I would recommend Brick Marketing to any of my clients.‚Äù‚Äì Elie Ashery, CEO Gold Lasso‚ÄúWe turned to Brick Marketing to assist in driving traffic to our website and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The flexible approach of the SEO firm Brick Marketing helped us meet our goals, drive traffic to our website, and increase the number of calls we received regarding our services.

The results speak for themselves ‚Äì over the last two years, Brick Marketing has helped increase our Google traffic by 315.43%. From the solid SEO foundation Brick Marketing built for GrowthForce during our initial onboarding, to our ongoing daily/weekly tasks and our monthly analytics and check in calls, our Brick team keeps us on track and up to date. They take the headache out of SEO so we don‚Äôt ever have to spend time in the weeds learning about the latest rules or SEO challenges, and they are quick to answer any of our questions.‚Äù‚Äì Kelly Boros, Marketing & Communications Manager GrowthForce‚ÄúAt Eliassen Group, a key goal of our website is to generate client and candidate leads, which can get a bit complex, given that we‚Äôre in multiple lines of business. Members¬†of the Brick Marketing were instrumental in developing SEO strategies for each line of business, and perfectly understood the nuances and subtleties of each of them, developing a set of keywords that they seamlessly placed into our copy, which had been developed using a series of personas. The monthly reporting provided to us clearly reflects tremendous progress since inception, and the number of leads generated since partnering with Brick Marketing has increased materially! We can‚Äôt be more appreciative of their personal commitment to us and our success, and ‚Äúhands on‚Äù management of our account. We trust them implicitly, and know that they keep our best interests in mind when managing our account.‚Äù‚Äì Tom Hart, Chief Operating Officer Eliassen Group‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how much we were missing from not having an online presence until I started working with the SEO firm Brick Marketing. The Brick Marketing team took the time to guide us through the SEO process and helped bring our company into the online world. We‚Äôve seen unbelievable success with our new website & owe much of our online lead generation to Brick Marketing‚Äôs efforts.‚Äù‚Äì George Athanasiadis, CEO, Somerset Industries‚ÄúLove working with the team at Brick Marketing! They are always available to answer my questions and assist with any concerns. I am very impressed with their thoroughness and ability to stay organized. Their passion and energy is always shown during conversations on our account.‚Äù‚Äì Corey Savage, CEO, Suncoast Identification Solutions, LLC‚ÄúI have formed an invaluable marketing partnership with Brick Marketing.  Nick Stamoulis and the rest of the Brick Marketing team are professional, timely, thorough and take time to, not only succeed at the tasks, but also educate myself and my team on the strategies in the process. Since my first encounter working with Brick, I‚Äôve changed organizations and have taken them along with me‚Ä¶they are that good! In my experience in working with many outside agencies who over-promise and under-communicate, I can truly state that Brick Marketing is levels above all others and vested in our relationship. They are not just an SEO consultant, but an integral part of my team. I highly recommend Brick Marketing for any company looking to significantly increase search engine competitiveness and internet presence.‚Äã‚Äù‚Äì Jodi Murphy, Marketing Director EUXmedia‚ÄúBrick Marketing is extremely valuable for feedback and advice in many aspects of marketing, not just SEO and I look forward to continuing to work with them over the long term to continually improve our business and increase sales. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. Just like their name implies, Brick Marketing is rock solid and essential in building a strong marketing foundation.‚Äù‚Äì Jeff Nicholson, President Freely Creative, Inc. / Websticker.com‚ÄúWe have worked with a few other SEO firms and consultants in the past, but, by far,
Brick Marketing has been our best experience. They are very knowledgeable about the search engine landscape, and help us respond to what seem like constant changes to the algorithms. They have helped our company correct some of the issues created by prior SEO firms, both in terms of on-site optimization and off-site programs. I appreciate the fact that Brick Marketing uses an ethical, strategic approach to SEO that creates a solid, lasting foundation for the future. They are reliable, responsive, and the quality of their deliverables is top-notch. We are happy we chose to work with them, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to engage a new SEO firm.‚Äù‚Äì Bob Bennett, Owner/Manager Bennett Awards‚ÄúI had worked with at least three other SEO companies before I was introduced to Brick Marketing. But when I met Nick Stamoulis at Brick Marketing, I knew that I was working with an honest and reputable company that would guide me through the world of SEO. In the six months since working with Brick Marketing, our goal for better presence on the internet has been achieved!‚Äù‚Äì Peter Feinmann, Feinmann, Inc.‚ÄúWhen we started working with Brick Marketing, we had just been subjected to a Google algorithm update and our websites both took substantial hits to traffic. Within a few months, Brick has taken both of our websites to pre-algorithm traffic and conversion levels, and for the CallFinder site, the traffic has increased over 80% year-over-year. Their expertise in SEO, responsive design, and content marketing helped us turn the situation around, and we could not be happier with the results we‚Äôve seen in just our first four months of working with them. The team we work with at Brick Marketing is always available for off-the-cuff consultations and are at the ready to provide recommendations and suggestions to improve our site‚Äôs appearance and performance. They are truly a hands-on partner, which is immensely valuable to our business.‚Äã‚Äù‚Äì Jeanne Landau, Director of Marketing www.800response.com | www.mycallfinder.com‚ÄúAfter searching extensively for a firm to aid in ramping up our Social Media efforts we choose Brick Marketing and have never looked back ‚Äì plus, enlisted their services for SEO and SEM. Nick Stamoulis and his Brick Marketing team are professional, timely, thorough and take the time to work through and explain each task step by step. In my experience in working with many outside agencies who over-promise and under-communicate, I can truly state that Brick Marketing is levels above all others and vested in our relationship. We feel they are not just a consultant, but an integral part of our team.‚Äù‚Äì Jodi Murphy Director of Marketing, SportsSignup‚ÄúBrick Marketing has been a dependable, professional SEO company that has helped us get results. In the last 6 months of using their services, visits to our website have increased by almost 30%. Our dedicated SEO Specialist was pleasant to deal with. Her suggestions for articles and press releases were industry specific. Brick Marketing always answered our phone calls and emails within an hour which made us feel valued as a client. I would recommend Brick Marketing to all businesses to handle their SEO needs.‚Äù‚Äì JoAnne Loftus, Archival Designs, Inc.‚ÄúThe Brick Marketing team, was critical to ensuring that our new Web site is optimized to drive maximum traffic. Our keyword rankings have improved and traffic has increased thanks to her assistance and advice. In addition, they executed a strategic link building program that helped further increase Web traffic.‚Äù‚Äì Lauren LaFronz, Director of Marketing, enChoice, Inc.‚ÄúBrick Marketing has been a tremendous resource for our business.  Through their expertise with the ever changing world of SEO, our web presence is as strong as ever.  Our working relationship with Nick Stamoulis and Danielle Bachini has been outstanding.  In collaboration with web designer Chris Roberts, we were also able to develop the perfect responsive website that truly reflects our business.  Thank you Brick Marketing!‚Äã‚Äù‚Äì Ellen Parlee, Parlee Farms‚ÄúThe SEO team at Brick Marketing have done a great job with our SEO program. Our overall website visitors are up and we‚Äôre seeing traffic for keywords that a year ago weren‚Äôt even on our radar. They‚Äôve always been willing to provide valuable input for any project we were working on and recently helped the company launch a brand new website, ensuring that our SEO efforts and value stayed intact.‚Äù‚Äì Trish Voskovitch, Sr. Manager, Marketing Programs Enkata‚ÄúBrick Marketing‚Äôs well researched SEO strategy has provided Fishman Corporation with visibility and excellent leads over the past year. Fishman Corporation competes in a niche industrial segment that has been dominated by one corporate conglomerate for 50 years; we were specifically looking for a Marketing partner that understood how to leverage SEO and social media to gain us visibility. We wanted to compete on the same level as the corporate giant. Brick Marketing has done this for us. We routinely show up high in organic searches, our web traffic has doubled and the leads that come in are well targeted. Brick‚Äôs SEO strategy has leveled the playing field; now the Davids‚Äô can be as visible as the Goliaiths.‚Äù‚Äì Scott Beebe President, Fishman Corporation‚ÄúI have been working with Brick Marketing for over 4 years now. Brick Marketing sends me the reports every month, but I don‚Äôt need to read them. I already know what he does is extremely effective because of all the web requests I get, phone calls from customers when they see their page come up on the first page of Google! I have worked with many other companies that made promises they could not keep. Brick Marketing has gotten me results and that is why I continue to work with them. I don‚Äôt have to micro-manage anything they do. I know that they always do what they say they are going to do. If you are looking for an SEO company, I would say, look no further as you have found the one that will do the job right! In addition to doing an excellent job, Nick Stamoulis is a pleasure to work with.‚Äù‚Äì Alan Cline, 1-800-PLUMBING‚ÄúWe hired Brick Marketing to manage our SEO, but they ended up also managing our company blog, social media marketing, helped us launch a pay per click advertising campaign, migrated our website to a new domain and so much more! Our SEO Specialist is always quick to respond whenever we had a question and went above and beyond to help us with any SEO issues.‚Äù‚Äì Mory Creighton, CEO, Pinpoint Laser Systems‚ÄúI have had the good fortune to work with SEO expert Nick Stamoulis and his team at Brick Marketing and it was clear form the get go that Nick had superior knowledge of marketing on the internet. The SEO campaign and technical writing that Brick Marketing provides has been impressive, where in the past we struggled to find the high levels of competence in these two skill sets. Were only just beginning with Brick Marketing and look forward to growing with their expert guidance. Thank you Nick Stamoulis and the Brick Marketing team!‚Äù- Craig Raubenheimer, President Roan Solutions, Inc.‚ÄúInitially, when we sought out assistance in SEO, we felt the Brick Marketing SEO offering may be too robust for the needs of our website. In hindsight, I am very glad that we decided their SEO services were worth the investment as they have proved to be an extremely valuable partner. Their tremendous expertise in b2b SEO practices and content strategy has already delivered a 59% increase in our organic web traffic. Brick Marketing has worked in close collaboration with our marketing team, tailoring their efforts to our specific needs as an FDA regulated company to ensure we are putting forward the highest quality content. I look forward to continuing our partnership with the Brick Marketing team to surpass our SEO goals!‚Äù‚Äì Brett Prince, Vice President of Marketing Corindus Vascular Robotics‚ÄúSilvon Software teamed up with Brick Marketing to deploy an SEO strategy that would generate greater visibility for our company within a highly competitive market and drive more prospects to our website as a result. This has included website optimization based on a well thought out keyword strategy, launch of a corporate blog, and the promotion of Silvon content via industry forums and numerous social media sites. In just a few months, Brick Marketing‚Äôs efforts has Silvon showing up higher in organic searches. Our web traffic overall has risen more than 30% and continues to grow. We‚Äôre seeing consistent month-to-month growth in the amount of organic traffic coming from Google. And, our referral traffic from LinkedIn has been phenomenal ‚Äî with initial increases as high as 468%! We couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the results that Brick Marketing has achieved so far and highly recommend them as a strategic marketing partner that knows how to put SEO best-practices to work for its clients.‚Äù‚Äì Pat Hennel Director, Global Marketing Services, Silvon Software, Inc.‚ÄúWe engaged Brick Marketing for SEO related activities for our website B2b.com and they did a fantastic job in assessing our website and finding out what was needed to optimize content and improve search engine traffic.

Additionally, they also trained our team in SEO techniques and kept us up to date with the changes brought in by Penguin/Panda updates. I highly recommend Brick Marketing for any SEO related projects.‚Äù‚Äì Navdeep Sidhu, Director ‚Äì B2B Product Marketing B2B.com‚ÄúAfter working with many other SEO firms and not being satisfied I finally was introduced to the Brick Marketing President and Founder, Nick Stamoulis. Nick Stamoulis has educated me about SEO and has provided me with a well rounded SEO package, not only does he offer top quality services he also educates his clients and spends the time to explain everything and their SEO pricing is competitive. I will highly recommend Brick Marketing to all of my clients. Brick Marketing is an A+ for SEO services.‚Äù‚Äì Mike Cardella, Integrated Computer Services‚ÄúAfter struggling for years to find the right SEO firm, it was a breath of fresh air to discover Brick Marketing. On my initial call with Brick Marketing President, Nick Stamoulis, it was immediately obvious that he genuinely cared about helping our company, not just bringing another client on board. Since then, their SEO work with us has been fabulous. Our dedicated SEO Specialist, alwyas¬†takes the time to explain every step of their efforts (and do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave me buried in a sea of SEO jargon). In addition to SEO, we also chose Brick Marketing to handle our website migration to WordPress, and once again, couldn‚Äôt have been happier with our decision to do so. The Brick Marketing team¬†made the process easy and painless, and made many helpful suggestions to improve our website that we would have never thought of on our own.

212,8128251,A new set of Firefox Developer Tools features,http://mzl.la/1pBoskZ,2014,"A new set of Firefox Developer Tools features has just been uplifted to the Aurora channel. These features are available right now in Aurora, and will be in the Firefox 33 release in October. This release brings many new additions, especially to the Inspector tool:Any node with a JavaScript event listener attached to it will now have an ‚Äúev‚Äù icon next to it in the Inspector. Clicking the icon will open a list of all the event listeners attached to that element. Click the pause icon to get taken to that function in the Debugger, where you can set breakpoints and debug it further. (development notes & UserVoice request)Keep in mind the events pane in the Debugger as well, which lists all the event listeners on the pageThere‚Äôs a new sidebar in the Style Editor which displays a list of shortcuts to every @media rule in the stylesheet (or Sass source) you‚Äôre editing. Click an item to jump to that rule. The condition text of the rule is greyed-out if the media query doesn‚Äôt currently apply. This works well in conjunction with the Responsive Design View (Opt+Cmd+M / Ctrl+Shift+M) for creating and debugging mobile layouts. (development notes)Right-click anywhere in the Rules section of the Inspector to get an ‚ÄúAdd Rule‚Äù option. Selecting this will add a new CSS rule, pre-populated with a selector that matches the currently selected node. (development notes & UserVoice request)Any @keyframes rules associated with the currently selected element are now displayed in the Rules section of the Inspector, and are editable. This is the first step on the way to better debugging of CSS animations. (development notes)To aid in editing easing animations, there‚Äôs now a cubic bezier editor that appears when you click the icon next to an animation timing function in a CSS rule. This feature used open source code from Lea Verou‚Äôs cubic-bezier.com. (development notes)There‚Äôs a new awesome way to visualize how an element has been transformed from its original position and shape. Hovering over a CSS transform property in the Inspector will show the original position of the element on the page and draw lines mapping the original points to their new positions. (development notes)You can disable the browser cache while you‚Äôre developing by checking Advanced Settings > Disable Cache in the Settings tab. Now this setting will persist the next time you open the devtools. As usual, caching is re-enabled for the tab when you close the tools. (development notes & UserVoice request)New commands have been added to the Developer Toolbar (Shift+F2):A host of editor preferences are now available in the Settings panel. From here you can change your indentation settings and change editor keybindings to Sublime Text, Vim, or Emacs. (development notes)A big feature called WebIDE has landed, but is behind a preference for this release while it gets more testing. WebIDE is a tool for in-browser app development. See WebIDE lands in Nightly for more details.Special thanks to the 33 contributors that added all the features and fixes in this release.Three of the features from this release came from feedback on the Developer Tools feedback channel, so that‚Äôs a great way to suggest features.

Yes, they are really nice features, we‚Äôre glad to have them in! Great new features! Was waiting for the event listeners and I am looking forward to soon test the keyframe editing and the transform highlighter.
I am having trouble with the ‚Äònew rule‚Äô on Mac OS, though. I seems only to display the new rule, after I e.g. resize the devtools. Interesting, thanks for the feedback. Is that behavior consistent every time? Yeap. I made a quick video. You can view/download it here, but the link works for three days only: https://spideroak.com/storage/OJSXI4TPOZSXE5DJM5XQ/shared/823533-1-1031/dev-tools_new-rule-after-resizing.ogg?24dacb2452803a21f18b7329f02048f7 Hmmm. Yeah, thanks for showing it. That seems to be a bug, please file a bug in Bugzilla. Thanks! Found an existing bug and added the video
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1045580Thanks Perfect, thank you! Did the 3D website view get removed from Firefox? No, it‚Äôs on the right hand side in Dev Tools. The icon for it looks like a cube. You do have to enable it first, however. Go to the settings tab of the devtools, and check off ‚ÄúAvailable Toolbox Buttons‚Äù > ‚Äú3D View‚Äù. The event listener and animation editing is spectacular!I think the cubic bezier thing has potential. I have some issues which I badly need cubic bezier help on. I‚Äôve been trying to do:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23475372/extrapolate-split-cubic-bezier-to-1-1https://gist.github.com/Noitidart/525a143e5407f4a7f3e2https://gist.github.com/Noitidart/0d7d73609404c6a9efb4I‚Äôm trying to start an animation at the 70% point of a cubic-ease. So the 70%-100% curve should be streched to actually be 0 ‚Äì 100%. Will this be possible with these tools? I badly need it. That is the reason Firefox is my default browser since its inception!
Thanks to all hard working developers! Good to hear and glad you like it! About Web IDE: I was late last time so I understandably didn‚Äôt get a response. Is their any planned integration with Emscripten C/C++ development? Off the top of my head, I don‚Äôt know more about that at this time. I‚Äôll check in with the development team, though. There is no Emscripten integration planned in the short term.  For folks with an established C++ environment and workflow, we‚Äôd like to extend their existing environments with a way to push to devices and test using WebIDE, but this isn‚Äôt planned in the short term. Well, good to know it‚Äôs being thought about, at least. Thanks for letting me know what the project‚Äôs plans and priorities are concerning this. Comments are closed for this article.

215,3862692,The War On RSS ,http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1932,2012,"If the lords of the Internet have their way, the days of RSS are numbered.AppleJohn Gruber was right, when pointing to Dan Frakes‚Äô review of the Mail app in Mountain Lion, to highlight the fact that the application drops support for RSS (he calls it an ‚Äúinteresting omission‚Äù, which is both correct and understated). It is indeed the most interesting aspect of the review, even though it‚Äôs buried at the bottom of the article; Along with the mention that RSS support appears to also be removed from Safari.[side note: here is the correct link for the Safari information; Dan Frakes‚Äô article mistakenly points to a staging server only available to MacWorld employees.]It‚Äôs not just John Gruber and I who think that‚Äôs significant. The disappearance of RSS is pretty much the topic of every comment on the two MacWorld articles (for Mail and Safari). That‚Äôs heartening. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of agitation to reverse the trend for RSS.The Mountain Lion setback, assuming it‚Äôs not reversed before the OS ships, is just the last of many blows to RSS.TwitterEvery twitter profile used to exhibit an RSS icon with the URL of a feed containing the user‚Äôs tweets. It‚Äôs gone. Don‚Äôt assume that‚Äôs just the result of a minimalist design because (a) the design is not minimalist and (b) the feed URL is also gone from the page metadata.The RSS feeds still exist (mine is http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/18518601.rss) but to find them you have to know the userid of the user. In other words, knowing that my twitter username is @vambenepe is not sufficient, you have to know that the userid for @vambenepe is 18518601. Which is not something that you can find on my profile page. Unless, that is, you are willing to wade through the HTML source and look for this element:If you know the Twitter API you can retrieve the RSS URL that way, but neither that nor the HTML source method is usable for most people.That‚Äôs too bad. Before I signed up for Twitter, I simply subscribed to the RSS feeds of a few Twitter users. It got me hooked. Obviously, Twitter doesn‚Äôt see much value in this anymore. I suspect that they may even see a negative value, a leak in their monetization strategy.[Updated on 2013/3/1: Unsurprisingly, Twitter is pulling the plug on RSS/Atom entirely.]FirefoxIt used to be that if any page advertised an RSS feed in its metadata, Firefox would show an RSS icon in the address bar to call your attention to it and let you subscribe in your favorite newsreader. At some point, between Firefox 3 and Firefox 10, this disappeared. Now, you have to launch the ‚Äúview page info‚Äù pop-up and click on ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù to see them listed. Or look for ‚Äúsubscribe to this page‚Äù in the ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù menu. Neither is hard, but the discoverability of the feeds is diminished. That‚Äôs especially unfortunate in the case of sites that don‚Äôt look like blogs but go the extra mile of offering relevant feeds. It makes discovering these harder.GoogleGoogle has done a lot for RSS, but as a result it has put itself in position to kill it, either accidentally or on purpose. Google Reader is a nice tool, but, just like there has not been any new webmail after GMail, there hasn‚Äôt been any new hosted feed reader after Google Reader.If Google closed GMail (or removed email support from it), email would survive as a communication mechanism (removing email from GMail is hard to imagine today, but keep in mind that Google‚Äôs survival doesn‚Äôt require GMail but they appear to consider it a matter of life or death for Google+ to succeed). If, on the other hand, Google closed Reader, would RSS survive? Doubtful. And Google has already tweaked Reader to benefit Google+. Not, for now, in a way that harms its RSS support. But whatever Google+ needs from Reader, Google+ will get.[Updated 2013/3/13: Adios Google Reader. But I‚Äôm now a Google employee and won‚Äôt comment further.]As far as the Chrome browser is concerned, I can‚Äôt find a way to have it acknowledge the presence of feeds in a page at all. Unlike Firefox, not even ‚Äúview page info‚Äù shows them; It appears that the only way is to look for the feed URLs in the HTML source.FacebookI don‚Äôt use Facebook, but for the benefit of this blog post I did some actual research and logged into my account there. I looked for a feed on a friend‚Äôs page. None in sight. Unlike Twitter, who started with a very open philosophy, I‚Äôm guessing Facebook never supported feeds so it‚Äôs probably not a regression in their case. Just a confirmation that no help should be expected from that side.[update: in fact, Facebook used to offer RSS and killed it too.]Not looking good for RSSThe good news is that there‚Äôs at least one thing that Facebook, Apple, Twitter and (to a lesser extent so far) Google seem to agree on. The bad news is that it‚Äôs that RSS, one of the beacons of openness on the internet, is the enemy.[side note: The RSS/Atom question is irrelevant in this context and I purposedly didn‚Äôt mention Atom to not confuse things. If anyone who‚Äôs shunning RSS tells you that if it wasn‚Äôt for the RSS/Atom confusion they‚Äôd be happy to use a standard syndication format, they‚Äôre pulling your leg; same thing if they say that syndication is ‚Äútoo hard for users‚Äù.]70 CommentsFiled under Apple, Big picture, Everything, Facebook, Google, Protocols, Social networks, Specs, Standards, TwitterMore on Twitter RSS ‚Äì http://www.somic.org/2011/07/27/following-on-twitter-using-rss.Maybe it‚Äôs because mail clients and browsers aren‚Äôt rss feed readers. Google Reader and the Reeder app is.
I don‚Äôt think blogs and news sites would remove rss support.i‚Äôve got to admit that i <3 RSS and still use RSS for twitter & fb and google reader on my mobile is my preferred way of filtering content (i star stuff to read later on ipad/laptop). as limited as rss is, without it we  *have* to have g+, fb and twitter accounts to consume that data that we can currently consume through a single interface. that means we have to suffer inconsistent interfaces from various vendors across devices, for example, when I read through twitter i favourite tweets that i want to come back to later, as i did with this link but facebook doesn't have a similar feature. I can like something and search my profile later to find it but it favours the content creator as i have to tell everyone about it and penalises the consumer because they don't get a curated list of content to consume on a more suitable device (bbc videos is the first thing that comes to mind ‚Äì flash only so doesn't work on iphone).the other problem with the disappearance of rss is that content creators now have to hook their content up to all of the networks to expose their work. a small blogger may need wordpress to create the content and twitter, fb and g+ to get it out there whereas wordpress has been publishing their rss for free and sending pingbacks to publicise it since it's inception.i understand why the powers that be wish to see the back of rss, it is in their interest to create walled gardens, but we'll all be much worse off for it. there is no way another standard like rss, or IMAP/SMTP/POP3 could ever gain a foothold anymore, there are two many vendors trying to lock people in to avoid competition rather than embrace it.while feeds definitely have a tough time in a world where all major players are trying to build their own ecosystems that expose as little information as possible to the outside, there are still many areas where feeds are being used. and even the walled garden players use them, when they serve their needs, such as apple building its whole podcast ecosystem on top of feeds. most users probably don‚Äôt know that podcasts are just feeds, but because they are, i don‚Äôt have to use itunes to consume them. if apple were doing it today, i am sure they would use a less open and somehow access-controlled approach, to make it harder for non-itunes clients to access podcasts.‚ÄúAs far as the Chrome browser is concerned, I can‚Äôt find a way to have it acknowledge the presence of feeds in a page at all.‚Äù*looks at the nice little RSS icon Chromium‚Äôs location bar*You haven‚Äôt mentioned browser extensions, like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd
(incidentally, made by Google).Marius, I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs no way (yes you can get Chromium or some browser extension), just that it‚Äôs harder than it used to be for a regular people to use RSS. Out of the box support for RSS (At least detecting the feeds) was a included in all major Web browsers. Until Google came out with Chrome.I agree with your point here, RSS is a second class citizen in Chrome, and the whole article is great.I believe the one thing that made it possible for me to switch to Chrome was an extension mimicking Firefox‚Äôs Live Bookmarks, called RSS Live Links (linked in my name). It also works for discovering feeds and the author has had to work around many limitations and bugs in Chrome, while minimal support for RSS (say, as an extension API) would likely make it much easier.However, I believe Google has (had?) a lot invested in RSS: Blogger, FeedProxy, Reader, Widgets and iGoogle. Groups, Code and Gmail have (had?) feeds. Are these also being reduced/hidden?For one, Opera does have a central RSS icon. It can utilize its built-in Mail app for viewing feeds, so a no-brainer there.But Safari supposedly still has RSS support too. http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html ‚Äì So I‚Äôd presume it‚Äôs really just a usability blunder in Firefox and Chrome.(Nice tip on Twitter though. Could never be bothered, and gave up when I couldn‚Äôt find any RSS feed. To me it always seemed like walled garden or anti-open-web syndrome.)On the ‚Äòno new reader after GReader‚Äô thing.https://www.newsblur.com/ <‚Äì This is what I use. It's pretty amazing. It even takes PubSubHubbub feeds and subscribes to them if available then gives you updates in real time.There are many good RSS readers.linkrdr is a new hosted RSS reader that aims to challenge Google‚Äôs dominance in the RSS reader space. Instead of just blindly serving up your RSS feed entries, it inspects their content and judges how interesting it likely is to you. Check it out.Tried it (linkrdr), sucks. ‚ÄúInternal server error‚Äù.http://newsblur.com is another great hosted RSS reader.
R.Facebook has had a few backflips on RSS (and I agree it seems like it‚Äôs glory days are behind it), but currently you can get RSS feeds for pages in two public lookups (ie: you don‚Äôt need to be authenticated)Find the ID based on the username using the graph API:
http://graph.facebook.com/OracleUse the ID of the page as a feed:
http://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?format=rss20&id=113897213765I switched to newsblur.com after years using Google ReaderWhat is an alternative to RSS/Atom?I think this is more about failing RSS applications than it is about RSS.Lifehacker ran a poll this week asking if people still use RSS. They got about 20,000 responses and almost everyone said yes.Twitter gives you a tiny quip and an obscured URL.  That‚Äôs information-empty.  I need to click on that link to find out if I want to bother reading the piece. That is a waste of my time.Very good analysis. But I think we should change the way we look at RSS. Here‚Äôs a short piece I wrote about it http://apas.gr/rss-twitter/You don‚Äôt need the userid for the RSS url http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/vambenepe.rss‚ÄúIf, on the other hand, Google closed Reader, would RSS survive? Doubtful.‚ÄùI am pretty sure this assumption is wrong and I am pretty sure that the closing of Reader will see the opening of a dozen other services that will try to fill the gap.RSS is not alive because we can easily subscribe to a lot of feeds. (hint: we can‚Äôt) It is alive because it‚Äôs a nice and useful technology.The RSS button in Firefox has been removed with version 4, because only 3% of all users ever clicked it: http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/01/firefox-4-ditches-the-rss-button-heres-how-to-get-it-back/there hasn‚Äôt been any new hosted feed reader after Google Reader.Newsblur might disagree with you on that; as far as I know, the service has grown quite a lot for its young age.It‚Äôs not that bad with Twitter (not that obvious either): http://evgeny-goldin.com/blog/twitter-rss-feeds/. There is an RSS feed for users, lists and queries, they just hide it in the API refs.‚ÄúGoogle reader RSS Subscriber‚Äù extension (http://goo.gl/pIKkz) provides a nice RSS icon in Chrome when feed is found.Most non-techies don‚Äôt understand how to use a RSS feed. I think that‚Äôs why it maybe removed, as those that know how to use it, will know how to modify the toolbar in FF or scour a site or page source for the feed url. I really hope sites continue to generate RSS feeds though, I use them a lot.Pingback: RSS is dead. Social streams have killed it. ¬´ ex post factofact: stackoverflow.com support rss, for each tag, at the buttom of the page you can find the rss feed.if the programming community consumes it, then the programming comunity will produce it.I use RSS every day. If there‚Äôs a blog that doesn‚Äôt offer RSS (or it‚Äôs just broken), it‚Äôs a blog that I don‚Äôt read!It‚Äôs also easy to monitize, you just thrown an ad on each entry. I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt bother me (as in, I don‚Äôt go removing feeds).But I‚Äôm kind of wierd, I showed up late to the rss game and now I host my own feed reader (feed on feeds by Steve Minutillo, wonderful software, easy to enhance).I suspect what big companies don‚Äôt like about RSS is that it‚Äôs harder to track? Even then, why not just track with an image? I dunno. It makes reading people‚Äôs blogs and news way easier for me.*cough* http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=vambenepeAllow me to disagree ‚Äî and I‚Äôm very happy to be able to do so. RSS is alive and well; it just completely failed to get adopted by the mainstream. I don‚Äôt think a lot of people would even be interested in subscribing to Twitter feeds and Facebook walls via RSS, so it‚Äôs not a big deal that these services have been phasing out support for it. At the same time, a lot of applications, some of them now becoming very popular with mainstream users, make extensive use of RSS behind the scenes (like Flipboard, or now Google Currents).RSS is doing just fine, it‚Äôs just ended up in another place than what we all were hoping for.H.actually you do not need to know the id for twitter, your username will suffice‚Ä¶ http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/user_timeline.format http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/vambenepe.rss

http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/vambenepe.xmlI think the biggest problem with RSS is that you divorce the content from the context. Both from the publisher‚Äôs standpoint, when their ads aren‚Äôt being served or they decide to truncate their RSS feed so they can get ad revenue back from click-through, and from the reader‚Äôs standpoint, where a common lamentation in moving to RSS is that you no longer get to read the original site regularly.I solved the ‚ÄúOriginal site‚Äù problem by building the original site into NewsBlur ‚Äî http://www.newsblur.com.The other big issue with RSS is that there are too many stories with a low signal-to-noise ratio. I built in filtering and highlighting into Newsblur to address that concern. And it‚Äôs a completely separate backend from Google Reader.And now the common refrain is that people use social channels (Twitter/FB/Tumblr) to find links and news. So I just built that into NewsBlur with shared stories. You can sign up to be a part of the private beta at http://dev.newsblur.com. I‚Äôll send out invites to anybody who signs up.Consuming the web through RSS can be problematic for both publishers and readers. I‚Äôm addressing the big three issues ‚Äì context, relevancy, and surfacing ‚Äì with a strong commitment to both readers and publishers. Let me know what else you would expect to see in your ideal reading setup, and chances are, RSS offers the foundation to build it.Pingback: Research Reports to Aid You in Your Strategy Efforts | The Savvy Strategist ‚Ñ¢On the other hand, look at Flipboard and its knock-offs/competitors that are getting a lot of users and press attention. Those wouldn‚Äôt exist without RSS.I stared subscribing to RSS through Google Reader because that was the only way to subscribe to online publications. Now I suppose I could follow a publication on Twitter but I could also possibly be getting unwanted white noise from the account holder.Google Reader is very basic. You can ‚Äústar‚Äù items for attention but it‚Äôs not even possible to tag items ala delicious style. And no, if Google did pull the rug on its Reader I doubt whether RSS would survive in any meaningful way.I‚Äôm interested in why RSS has failed. To me it seems an ideal format for keeping tabs on dozens or hundreds of different online publications.Is it because the RSS readers have proven to not be up to scratch or is it because the format itself is fundamentally flawed?I use RSS throughout the day, and frankly would waste a lot of hours not having it or never checking up on websites‚Ä¶.
I just wish Google would put more innovation into google reader.Interesting & surprising observations. In my mind, RSS should be as popular as ever, so it seems backwards that so much support for it is being dropped. My favorite iPad app is Flipboard, hands-down, and RSS drives it. Such a great reading experience.I think the biggest hurdle for RSS is getting the non-technically inclined to understand it.They see this orange ‚Äúspeaker-looking‚Äù icon and don‚Äôt give it a second thought.If you use Facebook or Tweeter chances are you don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to use RSS, so in the end it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Here the thoughts of an insider: http://twitter.com/#!/thekatz/status/189762825110028288
Unfortunately his computations are off by a few points ‚Äì you can‚Äôt have negative averages.I use Opera‚Äôs excellent RSS feeds feature and it works out great. It‚Äôs very convenient to have your feeds delivered directly in your browser, as opposed to having to check periodically a web application or another dedicated client.I don‚Äôt use Twitter, FaceBook, FireFox or Google Reader, so I am not particularly worried about any omissions they make (or may make) regarding RSS.I DO use Mail in OSX (Lion and Snow Leopard) on my Macs. The RSS reader has never worked correctly in Mail (at least not in the past 4 years that I had used it). It sometimes gets the feeds, and then stops and starts again. Sometimes it only gets the feeds I have subbed to if I am using that part of Mail. Often I have to restart Mail to get it to get the feeds again ‚Äì then it goes for a week or two before stopping. When it has stopped it goes back and gets feed articles I already have ‚Äì sometimes going back to 2007 (before I started using it) and then I have to delete thousands of articles. I notice that some of the articles are a few days to a week old, but they were not retrieved earlier.I have started to just mark those I want to keep or read as ‚Äúflagged‚Äù and then I can just delete most of the old unflagged articles it retreives. There are other interesting UI quirks in it too ‚Äì which don‚Äôt show up in the email portion of the app.But in short, Mail as an RSS reader is buggy. I suspect some of what I see may be problems with the feeds themselves, but I think it is mostly Mail. I know lots of other users have complained about the reader part of the app ‚Äì many of them have the same problems I have. No response from Apple or any improvements, so it isn‚Äôt surprising that they may remove it ‚Äì and I won‚Äôt be sad to see it go; it will make me get off my doofus and get a real reader which Apple can‚Äôt seem to make.IMHO companies prefer APIs as a means of content distribution because it keeps distribution more firmly under their control. They can see who is looking at what and how often, which even if not monetized directly, is important for understanding what‚Äôs happening with their business. They can also throttle access, shut of the tap completely, etc. All of which I‚Äôm sure can be done in RSS, but is awkward to do (i.e.: feedburner as an intermediary) as RSS was by design open. RSS, therefore isn‚Äôt specifically a leak in monetization, but rather a leak in distribution.In case you (or others) haven‚Äôt read it, Winer‚Äôs thoughts that are apropos: http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/13/howToRebootRss.htmlFacebook also allowed you to have your RSS feed automatically published to a fan page. Unfortunately they also killed this feature.  Viva the walled gardens!In FireFox you can get the feed icon back in the navigation toolbar by right clicking on the toolbar and choosing ‚Äúcustomize‚Äù.
Find it in the list and drag and drop it where you want. Done :)Well, how else are we supposed to keep up with our favorite news websites? Should everyone get twitter and post all new blogposts on there? Or a Google+ page or something similar? I‚Äôm assuming nobody wants to receive a newsletter.Don‚Äôt miss that WordPress.com promotes the subscription by mail or IM. RSS it‚Äôs becoming a l33t thing.There is more then just those few sites.
RSS is really ideal to follow the world from your smartphone.
Most blogs support itAnd as for twitter, thats more for too old people who want to be young, but real young people dont use it. They dont need a ‚Äúhey hear me‚Äù.Firefox has an easier way. It‚Äôs still hidden, butFirefox button ‚Äì> Options ‚Äì> Customize/Toolbar Layout ‚Äì> Drag the RSS button into the UII don‚Äôt know that there is a WAR on RSS at this point, but rather RSS functionality (consistent alerts to new content) is just being done in a couple of different ways for users that didn‚Äôt exist when RSS was first launched.The first is more content publication platforms have better APIs that can be hit with a get request (for those aggregating content).  Second, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr (and others) have begun to aggregate things for us and feed it to us that way.  Users check them all the time.  Many blogs (including my own) cross-post to Twitter and Facebook so if you read it on RSS you get it a 3rd time.  I think people have just chosen to go the route that allows them to engage (comment back, receive replies, etc) rather than the route that is just consumption(RSS) that requires you to head to a site.I will still continue to use RSS and I think the standard is definitely valuable, but if Flipboard one day decides to just pull from any blog with the right APIs and aggregate that way I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be too up in arms about it.I do agree to your point that we need to ensure there is an open syndication capability so that people don‚Äôt lose the ability to monitor a large number of pages, but I think the market will take care of that gap if it exists.Thanks for the thought-provoking post.I think that the way news feeds are delivered is changing, and RSS isn‚Äôt the answer. I used to be an avid user of Google Reader, but my feeds there have been left unread for weeks now. I switched to Prismatic, a new service that grabs stories based on what links are retweeted by people you follow. I think we‚Äôre going to be seeing a lot more of this, as people start becoming more interested in curated news feeds, rather than just grabbing prepared feeds from third-party sources.It‚Äôs too bad only Google knows the actual traffic to Google Reader.I see this as part of a great dumbing down that is going on.  It seems there are those who want to turn everybody into consumers.  That is people who take what they are given and happy to have little influence.  There are also a lot who are happy to be consumers.In the earlier days of the Interwebs this was less so.  In the mass market days it‚Äôs more so.Any company whose only / majority income stream is based on you clicking adverts, is not going to like a smart machine readable format.  With that you have the potential to make your own decisions, find stuff that actually suits you and avoid exposure to adverts that you‚Äôll never click on.Look at the companies you mention.  Does empowering users this way suit their goals.  If it doesn‚Äôt you can figure out the corporate strategy for yourself.A correction: Facebook does indeed have feeds.  They tend to be a little out of date, but they are there.  Essential I feel for FB users who live in RSS as much as they can.  It‚Äôs worth finding and using them if you use RSS.Google also does some very powerful RSS feeds.  A true service.  Great.As the majority of users are fairly new at the game, I‚Äôm hoping that they will tend toward an RSS using, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more in charge‚Äù approach as time goes on.  There may also be a rising tide of dislike against advertising (Recent PEW survey).  The smart strategists will factor that in.Good post, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. Fascinating to see the different angles from which this is all happening.Gruber has mentioned before that there‚Äôs actually a splintering effect when technology is typically expected to go obsolete. Even more than a war on RSS, this is a war on the software monoliths. Design is gaining a foothold and booting out the nonessentials. Speaking conversely to the web browser, dedicated RSS reader apps even expose features that are just awkward clutter and will probably disappear. But anyway, the technology we have been creating and using in the early days of the web is just doing what the entire web is doing‚Äìsplintering and walking into loving arms in little niches here and there. Gruber‚Äôs HTML / HTTP ‚Äú2 webs‚Äù line of thinking is pretty solid as a zoomed-out road map for the web, right down to these individually very useful technologies that seem to be disappearing. I would say QR codes are another example of a useful technology that has its place and will definitely be declared dead many times in the near future, without actually dying to those who need it most.It is interesting and helpful to see RSS documentation grouped in with API documentation, though. I would like to see some sort of standard for API documentation emerge, similar in visibility to robots.txt, to allow managers of a site or service to publish information on interacting with whatever data is available. 3rd party applications could then show possible means of interacting with that data that would have otherwise been difficult for end users to discern. Why should I have to google ‚ÄúTwitter API‚Äù or ‚ÄúService-name-here API‚Äù all the time?I‚Äôm also pretty excited to see those gigantic RSS icons disappear from even the oldest web 2.0 blogs. :-)Counterpoint ‚Äì Lifehacker just ran a poll of its readers and something like 90% of its users still actively use RSS.  I have heard similar figures for professional journalists.  It may be that the powers have be have reached the conclusion that RSS will never go mainstream, and yet it seems pretty firmly ensconced just below the surface.I‚Äôve been seeing the same thing and expressed my frustration on Twitter a few times: https://twitter.com/#!/OatBits/status/179569746495287297 and https://twitter.com/#!/OatBits/status/179571775863144448Getting an RSS-feed on a Youtube channel is as hard as getting it on a Twitter account. I¬†find myself searching for the same solutions a few times every month‚Ä¶‚ÄúGoogle has already tweaked Reader to benefit Google+. Not, for now, in a way that harms its RSS support.‚ÄùI¬†don‚Äôt really agree. Google removed one of the best parts of Google Reader (in favor of Google+):¬†Sharing. One could argue that this isn‚Äôt a part of the RSS¬†support, but in the way it was solved it was the best way of sharing a the content from an rss-feed.And no, the sharing capabilities that exists on Google+ today is far from as elegant as what we use to have on Google Reader.¬†For example:¬†Sharing flash video from somewhere else than Youtube and vimeo, sharing pictures directly from Reader (now only generates a link to the URL, and not a post with the picture inside it), sharing text/news/blog posts/etc (again only a link, not the content itself is shared), and so on‚Ä¶I noticed this trend as well (especially regarding Twitter and Chrome), and am concerned about it. My feeds (I‚Äôm recommending newsblur.com) is my daily filter for finding out about new things.It seems that there is little I can do as a user of a site that does drops RSS support. After all, I (usually) don‚Äôt pay (directly) for content and could get my information somewhere else. Any bright ideas on this?Thank you for the article, I‚Äôm glad to see people writing about this.In firefox: view -> toolbars -> customize -> drag rss button to your favorite location :)Before you jump all over me, I like RSS, use RSS readers and will miss RSS when it‚Äôs gone. But‚Ä¶Two simple reasons why RSS is dying: 1. Civillians (that is people who use Facebook etc. and don‚Äôt really care about technology) never really used RSS. In all of my mass-market work over the years we never saw either demand nor, when offered, adoption of the RSS feed model by ordinary people. I know it‚Äôs hard to imagine that RSS is ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù when it‚Äôs not really that hard to set up a reader and feeds‚Ä¶but in a world where people don‚Äôt (and soon won‚Äôt need to) understand files vs. folders vs. programs, an RSS reader is just too nerdy. 2. Money. While various ads are sometimes stuffed awkwardly into my RSS feeds, on the professional side (as in my work that sometimes involves online advertising)  they never really worked and the performance ‚Äì as compared to other options like search or ‚Äì heaven forbid ‚Äì web site display ‚Äì was just never even close. People who are consuming content via RSS are, perhaps, too focused on the content and perhaps unwilling to trade clicks or other advertiser-desirable behavior for access to free content.  In short, in an industry that is highly dependent on ad revenue, any technology that shows no proclivity to increase that revenue is going to fade away. Even if it‚Äôs awesome.It‚Äôs hard for business to support an open standard when it can dropped for the sake of same-content monetization.@Joakim : I read all my RSS feeds in Thunderbird .. a mail client.Pingback: The Word Nerd Content Marketing Checklist | Outspoken MediaPingback: Blogs stalk ... a lost knowledge? &gt; Journal Emanuel-SPingback: RSS will never die | Fruit BusinessRSS is alive and well albeit it now remains deeper in the stack.// business concerns
IMO the Twitters and browser vendors et al. ‚Äúdownsized‚Äù their support for RSS as consuming feeds takes people away from the sites that make their money on advertising and analytics but they cannot afford to drop support for RSS altogether as it remains the de facto standard protocol for describing and transporting media across the Internet.There is a rather recent blog article from the founder of WordPress and he explains they serve 7.5 million RSS feeds every week. And that‚Äôs just WordPress. If RSS goes away somebody has to reinvent blogging. Ain‚Äôt a gonna happen.// usage concerns
IMO the perception that the general public rejected RSS is a matter of perception. What I observed from day one was there very few opportunities for the general public to write RSS. Most RSS generators were crippleware written by script kiddies that could and would only generate title, link and description, only a few even supported enclosures and fewer yet supported Media RSS.Add the fact that NOBODY supported the entire specification or Media RSS and all anybody could get (in general) was lame title, link and description so branding suffered as did a lot of other usability concerns.I have been developing an RSS CMS that supports the entire 2.0 specification including Media RSS. RSS itself continues to be extensible and despite the emergence of JSON the use of RSS remains invaluable to web developers and publishers as JSON is not readable and JSON naming is not standardized. Hence, integration of services using JSON requires each developer to have a person-to-person conversation with one another to agree how their code should be written. JSON is therefor only useful on a 1:1 basis (loosely speaking that is as there are always exceptions to the norm) whereas RSS remains 1:x (many)I have bet the farm believing the emerging era of connected TV will result in a resurgence of ‚Äúchannels‚Äù as RSS remains the perfect format for TV guides as well as serving video in real-time using cloud services. Code to parse RSS is everywhere and can be copied and pasted by the neophytes.IMO HTML5 will also help bring a resurgence of RSS too as XSLT(ransformation) 2.0 to HTML5 is becoming supported by the modern browsers such as Chrome and others.RSS may remain embedded into the stack and not all that visible on the UI but RSS itself is not going away anytime soon as there are too many valuable uses for RSS.Nice article, inspirating for burning something :)I guess RSS should (must?) be replaced by something equally useful but PUSH style, XMPP is best candidate IMHO. Nowadays there are one or several XMPP libraries for each language and is really easy to code a piece of software that subscribes to a pub/sub account.Let‚Äôs make this evolve ourselves before some 2.0 BigBangBoomBubble Company ‚Äúinvents‚Äù something to subscribe to ‚Äúnews feeds and site updates‚Äù and do it with their own propietary protocol.Pingback: business model innovation design ¬ª Bookmarks for April 24th through April 29thPingback: The death of RSS ¬´ A Web That WorksRSS is a great tool, but most of the people even some tech people don‚Äôt understand it or know it.

	The competitive landscape for app development tool providers keeps getting¬†tighter, with Meteor Development Group raising $20 million for its stack of frameworks and tools for developing web and mobile applications in JavaScript.The round, led by Matrix Partners with investments also coming in from Andreessen Horowitz and Trinity Ventures, will give MDG the resources it needs to offer paid products that supplement its open source framework and tools.Meteor Development Group CEO Geoff Schmidt laid out a rough road map for the company‚Äôs upcoming offerings in a phone call with TechCrunch yesterday. First up is Galaxy, a system for running Meteor applications based on Google‚Äôs open source Kubernetes project, which itself is a system for managing resources for applications running as services in containers.Slated for full release later this year, Schmidt says Galaxy will first roll out to a select group of companies who already have apps in production using Meteor. These companies will work closely with MDG, providing feedback on how it fits into their workflows as well as insight into how it performs in the real world. When it opens up to more customers after the early access period, Galaxy will be available in free, pay-by-the-hour, and enterprise tiers.MDG has built Galaxy to initially run on Amazon Web Services, with Schmidt citing demand from developers working on Amazon‚Äôs infrastructure. But in the future, Galaxy will work across infrastructure providers, with support for Microsoft Azure and Google‚Äôs Cloud Platform in the works.But Galaxy is just the first piece of a much larger puzzle. Schmidt told me that building and hosting applications are important, but things like app performance analytics and testing are just as vital to the ongoing development process and Meteor has software in the pipeline that will address those as well.In addition to its long-run efforts, Meteor also has more immediate work going into the open source platform to make it useful to even more developers. While Meteor offers a library¬†that can handle UI, some developers might prefer to use Angular or React. Meteor‚Äôs modular nature means those dedicated to other UI frameworks have been able to get them working, but Schmidt says work is going into supporting them more directly. The same can be said for Windows support, which has been in development for some time.Latest headlines delivered to you daily"

Hi Gabor,

I am the original author of GNU grep.  I am also a FreeBSD user,
although I live on -stable (and older) and rarely pay attention
to -current.

However, while searching the -current mailing list for an unrelated
reason, I stumbled across some flamage regarding BSD grep vs GNU grep
performance.  You may have noticed that discussion too...

Anyway, just FYI, here's a quick summary of where GNU grep gets
its speed.  Hopefully you can carry these ideas over to BSD grep.

#1 trick: GNU grep is fast because it AVOIDS LOOKING AT
EVERY INPUT BYTE.

#2 trick: GNU grep is fast because it EXECUTES VERY FEW
INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH BYTE that it *does* look at.

GNU grep uses the well-known Boyer-Moore algorithm, which looks
first for the final letter of the target string, and uses a lookup
table to tell it how far ahead it can skip in the input whenever
it finds a non-matching character.

GNU grep also unrolls the inner loop of Boyer-Moore, and sets up
the Boyer-Moore delta table entries in such a way that it doesn't
need to do the loop exit test at every unrolled step.  The result
of this is that, in the limit, GNU grep averages fewer than 3 x86
instructions executed for each input byte it actually looks at
(and it skips many bytes entirely).

See ""Fast String Searching"", by Andrew Hume and Daniel Sunday,
in the November 1991 issue of Software Practice & Experience, for
a good discussion of Boyer-Moore implementation tricks.  It's
available as a free PDF online.

Once you have fast search, you'll find you also need fast input.

GNU grep uses raw Unix input system calls and avoids copying data
after reading it.

Moreover, GNU grep AVOIDS BREAKING THE INPUT INTO LINES.  Looking
for newlines would slow grep down by a factor of several times,
because to find the newlines it would have to look at every byte!

So instead of using line-oriented input, GNU grep reads raw data into
a large buffer, searches the buffer using Boyer-Moore, and only when
it finds a match does it go and look for the bounding newlines.
(Certain command line options like -n disable this optimization.)

Finally, when I was last the maintainer of GNU grep (15+ years ago...),
GNU grep also tried very hard to set things up so that the *kernel*
could ALSO avoid handling every byte of the input, by using mmap()
instead of read() for file input.  At the time, using read() caused
most Unix versions to do extra copying.  Since GNU grep passed out
of my hands, it appears that use of mmap became non-default, but you
can still get it via --mmap.  And at least in cases where the data
is already file system buffer caches, mmap is still faster:

  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep -l 123456789abcdef'
  real	0m1.530s
  user	0m0.230s
  sys	0m1.357s
  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep --mmap -l 123456789abcdef'
  real	0m1.201s
  user	0m0.330s
  sys	0m0.929s

[workload was a 648 megabyte MH mail folder containing 41000 messages]
So even nowadays, using --mmap can be worth a >20% speedup.

Summary:

- Use Boyer-Moore (and unroll its inner loop a few times).

- Roll your own unbuffered input using raw system calls.  Avoid copying
  the input bytes before searching them.  (Do, however, use buffered
  *output*.  The normal grep scenario is that the amount of output is
  small compared to the amount of input, so the overhead of output
  buffer copying is small, while savings due to avoiding many small
  unbuffered writes can be large.)

- Don't look for newlines in the input until after you've found a match.

- Try to set things up (page-aligned buffers, page-sized read chunks,
  optionally use mmap) so the kernel can ALSO avoid copying the bytes.

The key to making programs fast is to make them do practically nothing. ;-)

Regards,

	Mike

219,7713321,Apparently Dudes Who Use Female Avatars In MMORPGs Aren‚Äôt Doing It Right,http://www.geekosystem.com/male-gamers-female-avatars/,2014,"You can play literally any type of character you want in most MMORPGs. Feel like being a dwarf? Awesome. A shapeshifer? Go for it. So of course some curious players are going to wonder what it‚Äôs like to be a gender other than the one they identify as. But when male players try to roleplay female characters, they start acting kinda weird. Like,¬†really weird.Researchers at¬†Concordia University, Colorado State University, Syracuse University, Hofstra University and the University of Toronto were interested in determining whether or not socially conditioned gender norms are present in the way that we play online games.¬†To do this, they took gameplay footage from 375 players in¬†World of Warcraft¬†and studied the different behaviors that each gamer exhibited, including their movement, chats, and interactions with objects in the game world.¬†Among these players, about 23% percent of male-identified characters chose female avatars, compared to 7% of female-identified players who did the opposite.According to the researchers‚Äô results, which were recently published in Information, Communication and Society, male players who play female characters behave very differently than female players playing female characters, most tellingly in the way that they move. For some weird reason, they tend to ‚Äúmove backwards more often‚Äù and are more likely to physically distance themselves from the rest of their party. They also use a lot more smiling emoticons, tend to select more conventionally attractive avatars (duh), and jump around a lot more than female players ‚Äî 116 times more on average, as a matter of fact.The research team thinks that this could be because many male players use female avatars so that other male players will be nicer to them (which is hilarious¬†given the way that female players are treated in a lot of other multiplayer games),¬†so jumping around is a way to hold their attention.¬†Regardless, the effect is the same: men who are deliberately¬†playing as women appear to adopt different strategies based on how they think women act, and those strategies appear to be nothing like what women do in the same circumstances.‚ÄúOur findings support feminist theories suggesting that although gender is a powerful social category, there is a range of ways it can be performed,‚Äù¬†Concordia University professor¬†Mia Consalvo said.¬†‚ÄúMen may not necessarily try to mask their offline¬†gender¬†when they use a female avatar, but our study shows they do reinforce idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication.‚ÄùOf course, the study isn‚Äôt a perfect smackdown of performative gender roles. The sample size is admittedly very small, and it‚Äôs hard to tell if they were able to take the¬†behaviors of trans or non-binary players into account, or if such players were even sought out (see the edit below for more on this).¬†But the idea that much of gender is dependent on tightly constructed social expectations? That‚Äôs something we can get behind.And if you do see a female-avatar in¬†World of Warcraft¬†who‚Äôs jumping up and down and :)-ing at you a lot? Don‚Äôt question it too much or try to ‚Äúout‚Äù the gender they¬†identify with offline. It‚Äôs just a game, after all. Who cares what the person on the other end of the sexy elf ranger is like in real life?¬†EDIT 5/8/2014 12:37pm:¬†It was pointed out to me on Twitter that my initial write-up messed some stuff up, so I want to sincerely apologize and make my own views a little clearer for the record. From what I can tell, I don‚Äôt think that the study did enough to move past the outdated idea of gender binarism, which is not good at all. However, I do think the conclusion that the study comes to ‚Äî¬†that gender expression is often very performative on a subconscious level ‚Äî is definitely worth talking about. And, of course, the performative nature of gender doesn‚Äôt make it less valid, which is why we should all try not to be jerks to people based on how we think they should be identifying or acting. Online or off, that‚Äôs no way to be.(via Phys.org, image via Pyckle‚Äôs Fashion Plates)Meanwhile in related linksHave a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

But not everyone can partake in the boom. In many states, unfavorable rules still make it too hard or expensive for homeowners and companies to go solar, stunting clean-energy growth in even the sunniest neighborhoods.Solar advocates say the utilities are largely to blame for the mismatch in policies. Giant electricity companies see privately owned rooftop systems as a threat to their bottom lines, and they‚Äôre fighting through regulation and legislation to maintain market share, solar groups argue. Utilities say their only interest is ensuring electricity remains affordable and reliable for all of their customers, regardless of the power source.The policy battles are intensifying as solar adoption climbs. Nearly 200,000 homes and businesses added rooftop or on-site solar installations in 2014, bringing the total count to more than 600,000 nationwide, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research. The market for solar photovoltaics is now worth more than $13 billion, up from just $3 billion six years ago.The latest front in the solar fight is unfolding over ‚Äúgrid access fees,‚Äù which solar users must pay to the utility in exchange for hooking their systems to the main electric grid. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen major increased interest by utilities‚Äù in this area, said Katie Ottenweller, who leads the Southern Environmental Law Center‚Äôs solar initiative in Atlanta. ‚ÄúWe really see this as utilities effectively penalizing customers for buying less of the utility‚Äôs product.‚ÄùArizona Public Service Co. (APS), the main utility in Arizona, last week asked state regulators to allow the company to raise monthly rooftop solar fees from about $5 to about $21. PNM, the largest electricity provider in New Mexico, has proposed a monthly fee of around $30. In Alabama and Virginia, utility customers already are¬†paying similar amounts.The utilities say the fees are a matter of fairness. Solar panel owners still depend on the grid to light their homes when the sun isn‚Äôt shining, and yet they‚Äôre not necessarily paying for that access. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt use the grid, you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for it. But if you do, you should pay your fair share. And today, virtually everyone uses the grid,‚Äù Marc Romito, APS‚Äô manager for renewable energy, said in a statement about the utility‚Äôs proposed fee hike.Power companies also are pushing to limit ‚Äúnet metering‚Äù programs. Under these policies, solar users sell their excess electricity to the utility for a set fee, which allows customers to dramatically reduce their utility bills. In coal-rich West Virginia, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin last month passed a bill to revise the state‚Äôs net metering rules, a move critics say will discourage future investment in rooftop solar power. Policymakers in Arizona, Florida and Washington also are considering capping the number or size of systems that can participate in net metering plans.Solar advocates say the push to raise grid access fees or water down incentive programs ignores the economic benefits that rooftop systems supply to the grid. For instance, solar panels generate the most power in the middle of the day, when overall electricity demand is highest. By supplying more power to the system, solar systems take pressure off the grid and reduce the need for utilities to build additional power plants. In Maine, the value of solar power is estimated to be 33 cents per kilowatt-hour, in terms of avoided transmission and fuel costs and reduced greenhouse gas benefits, according to a recent study by clean energy group Acadia Center. A similar report on Connecticut valued solar power at 20 cents per kilowatt-hour in the state.‚ÄúIt means when someone decides to use their own money to buy a solar system and put it on their roof to power their energy usage, that provides value not just for them but for their neighbors as well,‚Äù said Adam Browning, executive director of Vote Solar, an advocacy group in Oakland, California. Despite the benefits, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing across the country a reaction of utilities to try to put up roadblocks and barriers to people generating their own power.‚ÄùA new report by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (FCIR) found evidence of such pushback in Florida, which is lagging other sun-soaked states in solar power development. Former legislators suggested that the political heft of large utilities has prevented policymakers from adopting rules that would encourage residents to install rooftop solar systems.In Florida, as in other states, utilities hold a monopoly on supplying power under existing laws. Floridians can purchase their own arrays -- which cost between $15,000 and $30,000 -- but they can‚Äôt take advantage of the third-party lease programs that have exploded in states like California and New Jersey. Under those programs, companies such as SolarCity Corp. and SunEdison Inc. can install panels for free and sell the clean power to the homeowner at a rate lower than what utilities charge. They‚Äôre an attractive way for people to go solar without shelling out tens of thousands of dollars.Solar proponents in Florida are proposing to change the state‚Äôs constitution to allow third-party solar sales in the state, and a ballot initiative may appear in the 2016 elections. But utilities are sure to fight the plan, including by making campaign donations to Florida state legislators. The state‚Äôs four largest power companies -- Duke Energy, Gulf Power, Florida Power & Light and Tampa Electric -- have together made $12 million in campaign donations since 2010, according to the FCIR report.‚ÄúWe in Florida are stuck in the Stone Age,‚Äù state Rep. Dwight Dudley, a Democrat from St. Petersburg who supports the solar industry, told FCIR. He cited the utility campaign donations as a reason pro-solar bills have struggled in Florida.A pro-solar bill in North Carolina already is facing resistance from Duke Energy after state Rep. John Szoka, a Republican, proposed the measure last week. The bill would allow third-party companies to lease panels and sell solar power in the state, which is prohibited under the state's existing monopoly laws. Duke says it‚Äôs not opposed to rooftop solar power -- it just wants a measure that covers reforms of the entire industry, and not only a single policy.‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôd like to see instead is a more collaborative and comprehensive approach on solar issues in North Carolina,‚Äù said Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for the Charlotte-based energy giant. ‚ÄúDealing with one at a time is not as productive as getting them all on the table.‚ÄùHe pointed to the solar policy recently approved in South Carolina, which will allow residents for the first time to lease solar panels from third parties, to sell solar power back to the utility under net metering and to avoid grid access fees, at least until the end of 2020, when the plan will be revisited. The state‚Äôs plan won‚Äôt allow private solar companies to sell power back to the grid, however, which is what policymakers are seeking in North Carolina. Wheeless also applauded a solar bill in Georgia, which cleared the state legislature last week and is headed for Gov. Nathan Deal's desk. The plan also enables customers to access third-party financing and earned the backing of free-market conservative groups opposed to the state's utility monopoly.Wheeless said Duke will propose its own solar plan to North Carolina‚Äôs General Assembly, though the utility hasn‚Äôt yet determined when it will submit the report. In the meantime, the utility is expanding its own solar power portfolio, which now includes around 550 megawatts of large-scale projects. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been very busy with solar,‚Äù he said.The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy."

		                                     BENJINA, Indonesia ‚Äì ¬†At first the men filtered in, by twos and threes, hearing whispers of a possible rescue.Then, as the news rippled around the island, hundreds of weathered former and current slaves streamed out, many with long, greasy hair and tattoos. They came from trawlers and villages, even out of the jungle, running toward what they had only dreamed of for years: Freedom.""I will go see my parents. They haven't heard from me, and I haven't heard from them since I left,"" said Win Win Ko, 42, who's been gone from Myanmar for four years. His smile revealed a mouthful of missing teeth, kicked out by the Thai captain on his fishing boat with military boots, he said, because Win was not moving fish fast enough from the deck to the hold below.The Burmese men were among hundreds of migrant workers revealed in an Associated Press investigation to have been lured or tricked into leaving their countries to go to Thailand, where they were put on boats and brought to Indonesia. From there, they were forced to catch seafood that was shipped back to Thailand and exported to consumers around the world, including the United States. In response to the AP's findings, Indonesian officials visited the island village of Benjina on Friday and offered immediate evacuation after finding brutal conditions, down to an ""enforcer"" paid to beat men up.The officials first gave the invitation for protection just to a small group of men who talked openly about their abuse. But then Asep Burhanuddin, director general of Indonesia's Marine Resources and Fisheries Surveillance, said everybody was welcome, including those hiding in the forest.""They can all come,"" he said. ""We don't want to leave a single person behind.""About 320 men took up the offer. Even as a downpour started, some dashed through the rain. They sprinted back to their boats, jumped over the rails and threw themselves through windows. They stuffed their meager belongings into plastic bags, small suitcases and day packs, and rushed back to the dock, not wanting to be left behind. A small boat going from trawler to trawler to pick up men was soon loaded down.Throughout the day and until darkness fell, they kept coming, more and more men, hugging, laughing, spilling onto the six trawlers that were their ride out. Even just before the boats pushed off Benjina for the 24-hour trip to neighboring Tual island, fishermen were still running to the shore and clambering onto the vessels. Some were so sick and emaciated, they stumbled or had to be carried up the gang plank.While excitement and relief flooded through many of the men on the dock, others looked scared and unsure of what to expect next. Many complained they had no money to start over.""I'm really happy, but I'm confused,"" said Nay Hla Win, 32. ""I don't know what my future is in Myanmar.""Indonesian officials said security in Benjina is limited, with only two navy officials stationed there to protect them. The men will instead be housed at a government compound on Tual while immigration issues are sorted out. Officials from Myanmar are set to visit the islands next week and will assist with bringing the men home and locating others.The dramatic rescue came after a round of interviews Indonesian officials held with the fishermen, where they confirmed the abuse reported in the AP story, which included video of eight migrants locked in a cage and a slave graveyard. The men, mostly from Myanmar, talked of how they were beaten and shocked with Taser-like devices at sea, forced to work almost nonstop without clean water or proper food, paid little or nothing and prevented from going home.There was essentially no way out. Benjina is in the far reaches of Indonesia and so remote, there was no phone service until a cell tower was installed last month, and it is a difficult place to reach in the best of circumstances.Some of the men said the abuse went even further at the hands of an Indonesian man known as ""the enforcer."" He was deeply feared and hated by the workers, who said he was hired by their boat captains to punish them for misbehavior.Saw Eail Htoo and Myo Naing were among those tormented. After three months at sea working with only two to four hours of sleep a night, the two Burmese slaves just wanted to rest and fell asleep on the deck as soon as they hit shore.They said their Thai captain decided to make an example of them. So the two were driven by motorbike up a hill above the port. They were handcuffed together and placed in front of an Indonesian flag. Then they were punched in the face and kicked until they collapsed into the dirt, they said, blood oozing from their ripped faces.Even then, the enforcer would not stop.""He kept kicking me,"" said Naing, rail-thin with a military-style haircut. ""I kept thinking, if I was at home, this wouldn't be happening.""The findings documented by Indonesian officials and the AP came in stark contrast to what a Thai delegation reported from a visit to Benjina earlier this week when they searched for trafficked Thai nationals. They denied mistreatment on the boats and said the crews were all Thai, even though the AP found many migrant workers from other countries were issued fake documents with Thai names and addresses.""We examined the boats and the crews, and the result is most of the crews are happy and a few of them are sick and willing to go home,"" said Thai police Lt. Gen. Saritchai Anekwiang, who was leading the delegation. ""Generally, the boat conditions are good.""Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, has been under further pressure to clean up its industry since the AP tracked a boat of slave-caught seafood by satellite from Benjina to a port outside of Bangkok. Records then linked it to the supply chains of some of America's largest supermarkets and retailers and among the most popular brands of pet foods.The U.S. State Department said Friday that it is pressing Myanmar to quickly repatriate the men. U.S. companies also called for action and commended Indonesian officials.""We don't condone human trafficking in the supply chain, and we applaud the government's work to end this abuse. Our hearts go out to these men, and we wish them well on their journeys home,"" said Marilee McInnis, spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the U.S., which was among those the AP found with supply chains linked to tainted seafood.Last week, the International Organization for Migration said there could be as many as 4,000 foreign men, many trafficked or enslaved, who are stranded on islands surrounding Benjina following a fishing moratorium called by the Indonesian Fisheries Ministry to crack down on poaching. The country has some of the world's richest fishing grounds, and the government estimates billions of dollars in seafood are stolen from its waters by foreign crews every year.Three-quarters of the more than 320 migrant workers who left the island on Friday were Burmese, but about 50 from the country refused to go, saying they had not received their salaries and did not want leave without money.Some were also from Cambodia and Laos. A few Thais were allowed to board the boats, but the Indonesians said most Thai nationals could stay on Benjina more safely, since Thai captains were less likely to abuse them.""I expected to evacuate all of them, but I did not expect it this soon,"" said Ida Kusuma, one of the leaders of the Fisheries Ministry delegation. ""But I think it's good.""Police are investigating in Benjina and will decide whether to prosecute those involved in abuse, said Kedo Arya, head of Maluku province prosecutor's office. The Indonesian officials were told ""the enforcer"" was being detained.For those like Naing, who recalled being tortured, beaten and locked in a room for a month and 17 days for simply falling asleep, the thought of finally leaving the island was impossible to believe.""Is it real that we are going home?"" he asked.A firework soon shot off from one of the boats, signaling it was indeed time to go. The same trawlers where the fishermen had suffered years of abuse were heading back to sea. This time crowded with free men full of hope.____Mason reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

222,9733420,Amsterdam 3D Printed Bridge: Gravity-Defying Structure Will Be Built by Robots,http://www.inquisitr.com/2174733/amsterdam-3d-printed-steel-bridge-gravity-defying-structure-will-be-built-by-robots/,2015,"



Amsterdam will soon have a 3D printed steel bridge, and the gravity-defying structure is going to be built entirely by robots.The incredible accomplishment of modern technology will be utilizing 3D printing to construct the structure itself, and a multi-axis robot will be the one doing the building.The bridge is designed by artist and design expert Joris Laarman, who helped develop the 3D printer and the robot that will be using it.Two robots will be simultaneously welding small pieces of molten metal to the existing structure, creating lines of steel that will connect over a canal in Amsterdam. The end result will be a fully functional bridge that is not only the first of its kind but also a drawing point for the city.‚ÄúWe research and develop groundbreaking, cost-effective robotic technology with which we can 3D-print beautiful, functional objects in almost any form,‚Äù wrote the design and production company, MX3D, on the project‚Äôs webpage. ‚ÄúThe ultimate test? Printing an intricate, ornate metal bridge for a special location to show what our robots and software, engineers, craftsmen and designers can do.‚ÄùThe 3D printed steel bridge in Amsterdam is seen as a major step forward for three-dimensional printing technology.‚ÄúThis bridge will show how 3D printing finally enters the world of large-scale, functional objects and sustainable materials while allowing unprecedented freedom of form,‚Äù Laarman said. ‚ÄúThe symbolism of the bridge is a beautiful metaphor to connect the technology of the future with the old city, in a way that brings out the best of both worlds.‚ÄùEngineers and futurists have already hailed 3D printing technology as an advancement on par with the printing press, and its abilities are still being discovered.In a 2011 story, The Economist noted, ‚ÄúThree-dimensional printing makes it as cheap to create single items as it is to produce thousands and thus undermines economies of scale. It may have as profound an impact on the world as the coming of the factory did‚Ä¶ Just as nobody could have predicted the impact of the steam engine in 1750‚Äîor the printing press in 1450, or the transistor in 1950‚Äîit is impossible to foresee the long-term impact of 3D printing. But the technology is coming, and it is likely to disrupt every field it touches.‚ÄùThe 3D printed steel bridge is expected to make its debut in Amsterdam later this year, with construction expected to begin in September.[Image via MX3D]Now Watch This: Artist Living Inside Sculpted Rock EmergesNow Read This: Baker Mayfield Video: Drunk Oklahoma Quarterback Curses And Runs, Cops Slam HimAll content ¬© 2008

It's hard to know where to start with Ray Kurzweil. With the fact that he takes 150 pills a day and is intravenously injected on a weekly basis with a dizzying list of vitamins, dietary supplements, and substances that sound about as scientifically effective as face cream: coenzyme Q10, phosphatidycholine, glutathione?With the fact that he believes that he has a good chance of living for ever? He just has to stay alive ""long enough"" to be around for when the great life-extending technologies kick in (he's 66 and he believes that ""some of the baby-boomers will make it through""). Or with the fact that he's predicted that in 15 years' time, computers are going to trump people. That they will be smarter than we are. Not just better at doing sums than us and knowing what the best route is to Basildon. They already do that. But that they will be able to understand what we say, learn from experience, crack jokes, tell stories, flirt. Ray Kurzweil believes that, by 2029, computers will be able to do all the things that humans do. Only better.But then everyone's allowed their theories. It's just that Kurzweil's theories have a habit of coming true. And, while he's been a successful technologist and entrepreneur and invented devices that have changed our world ‚Äì the first flatbed scanner, the first computer program that could recognise a typeface, the first text-to-speech synthesizer and dozens more ‚Äì and has been an important and influential advocate of artificial intelligence and what it will mean, he has also always been a lone voice in, if not quite a wilderness, then in something other than the mainstream.And now? Now, he works at Google. Ray Kurzweil who believes that we can live for ever and that computers will gain what looks like a lot like consciousness in a little over a decade is now Google's director of engineering. The announcement of this, last year, was extraordinary enough. To people who work with tech or who are interested in tech and who are familiar with the idea that Kurzweil has popularised of ""the singularity"" ‚Äì the moment in the future when men and machines will supposedly converge ‚Äì and know him as either a brilliant maverick and visionary futurist, or a narcissistic crackpot obsessed with longevity, this was headline news in itself.But it's what came next that puts this into context. It's since been revealed that Google has gone on an unprecedented shopping spree and is in the throes of assembling what looks like the greatest artificial intelligence laboratory on Earth; a laboratory designed to feast upon a resource of a kind that the world has never seen before: truly massive data. Our data. From the minutiae of our lives.Google has bought almost every machine-learning and robotics company it can find, or at least, rates. It made headlines two months ago, when it bought Boston Dynamics, the firm that produces spectacular, terrifyingly life-like military robots, for an ""undisclosed"" but undoubtedly massive sum. It spent $3.2bn (¬£1.9bn) on smart thermostat maker Nest Labs. And this month, it bought the secretive and cutting-edge British artificial intelligence startup DeepMind for ¬£242m.And those are just the big deals. It also bought Bot & Dolly, Meka Robotics, Holomni, Redwood Robotics and Schaft, and another AI startup, DNNresearch. It hired Geoff Hinton, a British computer scientist who's probably the world's leading expert on neural networks. And it has embarked upon what one DeepMind investor told the technology publication Re/code two weeks ago was ""a Manhattan project of AI"". If artificial intelligence was really possible, and if anybody could do it, he said, ""this will be the team"". The future, in ways we can't even begin to imagine, will be Google's.There are no ""ifs"" in Ray Kurzweil's vocabulary, however, when I meet him in his new home ‚Äì a high-rise luxury apartment block in downtown San Francisco that's become an emblem for the city in this, its latest incarnation, the Age of Google. Kurzweil does not do ifs, or doubt, and he most especially doesn't do self-doubt. Though he's bemused about the fact that ""for the first time in my life I have a job"" and has moved from the east coast where his wife, Sonya, still lives, to take it.Bill Gates calls him ""the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence"". He's received 19 honorary doctorates, and he's been widely recognised as a genius. But he's the sort of genius, it turns out, who's not very good at boiling a kettle. He offers me a cup of coffee and when I accept he heads into the kitchen to make it, filling a kettle with water, putting a teaspoon of instant coffee into a cup, and then moments later, pouring the unboiled water on top of it. He stirs the undissolving lumps and I wonder whether to say anything but instead let him add almond milk ‚Äì not eating dairy is just one of his multiple dietary rules ‚Äì and politely say thank you as he hands it to me. It is, by quite some way, the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted.But then, he has other things on his mind. The future, for starters. And what it will look like. He's been making predictions about the future for years, ever since he realised that one of the key things about inventing successful new products was inventing them at the right moment, and ""so, as an engineer, I collected a lot of data"". In 1990, he predicted that a computer would defeat a world chess champion by 1998. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. He predicted the explosion of the world wide web at a time it was only being used by a few academics and he predicted dozens and dozens of other things that have largely come true, or that will soon, such as that by the year 2000, robotic leg prostheses would allow paraplegics to walk (the US military is currently trialling an ""Iron Man"" suit) and ""cybernetic chauffeurs"" would be able to drive cars (which Google has more or less cracked).His critics point out that not all his predictions have exactly panned out (no US company has reached a market capitalisation of more than $1¬†trillion; ""bioengineered treatments"" have yet to cure cancer). But in any case, the predictions aren't the meat of his work, just a byproduct. They're based on his belief that technology progresses exponentially (as is also the case in Moore's law, which sees computers' performance doubling every two years). But then you just have to dig out an old mobile phone to understand that. The problem, he says, is that humans don't think about the future that way. ""Our intuition is linear.""When Kurzweil first started talking about the ""singularity"", a conceit he borrowed from the science-fiction writer Vernor Vinge, he was dismissed as a fantasist. He has been saying for years that he believes that the Turing test ‚Äì the moment at which a computer will exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human ‚Äì will be passed in 2029. The difference is that when he began saying it, the fax machine hadn't been invented. But now, well‚Ä¶ it's another story.""My book The Age of Spiritual Machines came out in 1999 and that we had a conference of AI experts at Stanford and we took a poll by hand about when you think the Turing test would be passed. The consensus was hundreds of years. And a pretty good contingent thought that it would never be done.""And today, I'm pretty much at the median of what AI experts think and the public is kind of with them. Because the public has seen things like¬†Siri [the iPhone's voice-recognition technology] where you talk to a computer, they've seen the Google self-driving cars. My views are not radical any more. I've actually stayed consistent. It's the rest of the world that's changing its view.""And yet, we still haven't quite managed to get to grips with what that means. The Spike Jonze film, Her, which is set in the near future and has Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with a computer operating system, is not so much fantasy, according to Kurzweil, as a slightly underambitious rendering of the brave new world we are about to enter. ""A lot of the dramatic tension is provided by the fact that Theodore's love interest does not have a body,"" Kurzweil writes in a recent review of it. ""But this is an unrealistic notion. It would be technically trivial in the future to provide her with a virtual visual presence to match her virtual auditory presence.""But then he predicts that by 2045 computers will be a billion times more powerful than all of the human brains on Earth. And the characters' creation of an avatar of a dead person based on their writings, in Jonze's film, is an idea that he's been banging on about for years. He's gathered all of his father's writings and ephemera in an archive and believes it will be possible to retro-engineer him at some point in the future.So far, so sci-fi. Except that Kurzweil's new home isn't some futuristic MegaCorp intent on world domination. It's not Skynet. Or, maybe it is, but we largely still think of it as that helpful search engine with the cool design. Kurzweil has worked with Google's co-founder Larry Page on special projects over several years. ""And I'd been having ongoing conversations with him about artificial intelligence and what Google is doing and what I was trying to do. And basically he said, 'Do it here. We'll give you the independence you've had with your own company, but you'll have these Google-scale resources.'""And it's the Google-scale resources that are beyond anything the world has seen before. Such as the huge data sets that result from 1 billion people using Google ever single day. And the Google knowledge graph, which consists of 800m concepts and the billions of relationships between them. This is already a neural network, a massive, distributed global ""brain"". Can it learn? Can it think? It's what some of the smartest people on the planet are working on next.Peter Norvig, Google's research director, said recently that the company employs ""less than 50% but certainly more than 5%"" of the world's leading experts on machine learning. And that was before it bought DeepMind which, it should be noted, agreed to the deal with the proviso that Google set up an ethics board to look at the question of what machine learning will actually mean when it's in the hands of what has become the most powerful company on the planet. Of what machine learning might look like when the machines have learned to make their own decisions. Or gained, what we humans call, ""consciousness"".I first saw Boston Dynamics' robots in action at a presentation at the Singularity University, the university that Ray Kurzweil co-founded and that Google helped fund and which is devoted to exploring exponential technologies. And it was the Singularity University's own robotics faculty member Dan Barry who sounded a note of alarm about what the technology might mean: ""I don't see any end point here,"" he said when talking about the use of military robots. ""At some point humans aren't going to be fast enough. So what you do is that you make them autonomous. And where does that end? Terminator?""And the woman who headed the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the secretive US military agency that funded the development of BigDog? Regina Dugan. Guess where she works now?Kurzweil's job description consists of a one-line brief. ""I don't have a 20-page packet of instructions,"" he says. ""I have a one-sentence spec. Which is to help bring natural language understanding to Google. And how they do that is up to me.""Language, he believes, is the key to everything. ""And my project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means. When you write an article you're not creating an interesting collection of words. You have something to say and Google is devoted to intelligently organising and processing the world's information. The message in your article is information, and the computers are not picking up on that. So we would like to actually have the computers read. We want them to read everything on the web and every page of every book, then be able to engage an intelligent dialogue with the user to be able to answer their questions.""Google will know the answer to your question before you have asked it, he says. It will have read every email you've ever written, every document, every idle thought you've ever tapped into a search-engine box. It will know you better than your intimate partner does. Better, perhaps, than even yourself.The most successful example of natural-language processing so far is IBM's computer Watson, which in 2011 went on the US quiz show Jeopardy and won. ""And Jeopardy is a pretty broad task. It involves similes and jokes and riddles. For example, it was given ""a long tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping"" in the rhyme category and quickly responded: ""A meringue harangue."" Which is pretty clever: the humans didn't get it. And what's not generally appreciated is that Watson's knowledge was not hand-coded by engineers. Watson got it by reading. Wikipedia ‚Äì all of it.Kurzweil says: ""Computers are on the threshold of reading and understanding the semantic content of a language, but not quite at human levels. But since they can read a million times more material than humans they can make up for that with quantity. So IBM's Watson is a pretty weak reader on each page, but it read the 200m pages of Wikipedia. And basically what I'm doing at Google is to try to go beyond what Watson could do. To do it at Google scale. Which is to say to have the computer read tens of billions of pages. Watson doesn't understand the implications of what it's reading. It's doing a sort of pattern matching. It doesn't understand that if John sold his red Volvo to Mary that involves a transaction or possession and ownership being transferred. It doesn't understand that kind of information and so we are going to actually encode that, really try to teach it to understand the meaning of what these documents are¬†saying.""And once the computers can read their own instructions, well‚Ä¶ gaining domination over the rest of the universe will surely be easy pickings. Though Kurzweil, being a techno-optimist, doesn't worry about the prospect of being enslaved by a master race of newly liberated iPhones with ideas above their station. He believes technology will augment us. Make us better, smarter, fitter. That just as we've already outsourced our ability to remember telephone numbers to their electronic embrace, so we will welcome nanotechnologies that thin our blood and boost our brain cells. His mind-reading search engine will be a ""cybernetic friend"". He is unimpressed by Google Glass because he doesn't want any technological filter between us and reality. He just wants reality to be that much¬†better.""I thought about if I had all the money in the world, what would I want to do?"" he says. ""And I would want to do this. This project. This is not a new interest for me. This idea goes back 50 years. I've been thinking about artificial intelligence and how the brain works for 50 years.""The evidence of those 50 years is dotted all around the apartment. He shows me a cartoon he came up with in the 60s which shows a brain in a vat. And there's a still from a TV quiz show that he entered aged 17 with his first invention: he'd programmed a computer to compose original music. On his walls are paintings that were produced by a computer programmed to create its own original artworks. And scrapbooks that detail the histories of various relatives, the aunts and uncles who escaped from Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport, his great grandmother who set up what he says was Europe's first school to provide higher education for girls.His home is nothing if not eclectic. It's a shiny apartment in a shiny apartment block with big glass windows and modern furnishings but it's imbued with the sort of meaning and memories and resonances that, as yet, no machine can understand. His relatives escaped the Holocaust ""because they used their minds. That's actually the philosophy of my family. The power of human ideas. I remember my grandfather coming back from his first return visit to Europe. I was seven and he told me he'd been given the opportunity to handle ‚Äì with his own hands ‚Äì original documents by Leonardo da Vinci. He talked about it in very reverential terms, like these were sacred documents. But they weren't handed down to us by God. They were created by a guy, a person. A single human had been very influential and had changed the world. The message was that human ideas changed the world. And that is the only thing that could change the world.""On his fingers are two rings, one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied, and another that was created by a 3D printer, and on his wrist is a 30-year-old Mickey Mouse watch. ""It's very important to hold on to our whimsy,"" he says when I ask him about it. Why? ""I think it's the highest level of our neocortex. Whimsy, humour‚Ä¶""Even more engagingly, tapping away on a computer in the study next door I find Amy, his daughter. She's a writer and a teacher and warm and open, and while Kurzweil goes off to have his photo taken, she tells me that her childhood was like ""growing up in the future"".Is that what it felt like? ""I do feel little bit like the ideas I grew up hearing about are now ubiquitous‚Ä¶ Everything is changing so quickly and it's not something that people realise. When we were kids people used to talk about what they going to do when they were older, and they didn't necessarily consider how many changes would happen, and how the world would be different, but that was at the back of my head.""And what about her father's idea of living for ever? What did she make of that? ""What I think is interesting is that all kids think they are going to live for ever so actually it wasn't that much of a disconnect for me. I think it made perfect sense. Now it makes less sense.""Well, yes. But there's not a scintilla of doubt in Kurzweil's mind about this. My arguments slide off what looks like his carefully moisturised skin. ""My health regime is a wake-up call to my baby-boomer peers,"" he says. ""Most of whom are accepting the normal cycle of life and accepting they are getting to the end of their productive years. That's not my view. Now that health and medicine is in information technology it is going to expand exponentially. We will see very dramatic changes ahead. According to my model it's only 10-15 years away from where we'll be adding more than a year every year to life expectancy because of progress. It's kind of a tipping point in longevity.""He does, at moments like these, have something of a mad glint in his eye. Or at least the profound certitude of a fundamentalist cleric. Newsweek, a few years back, quoted an anonymous colleague claiming that, ""Ray is going through the single most public midlife crisis that any male has ever gone through."" His evangelism (and commercial endorsement) of a whole lot of dietary supplements has more than a touch of the ""Dr Gillian McKeith (PhD)"" to it. And it's hard not to ascribe a psychological aspect to this. He lost his adored father, a brilliant man, he says, a composer who had been largely unsuccessful and unrecognised in his lifetime, at the age of 22 to a massive heart attack. And a diagnosis of diabetes at the age of 35 led him to overhaul his diet.But isn't he simply refusing to accept, on an emotional level, that everyone gets older, everybody dies?""I think that's a great rationalisation because our immediate reaction to hearing someone has died is that it's not a good thing. We're sad. We consider it a tragedy. So for thousands of years, we did the next best thing which is to rationalise. 'Oh that tragic thing? That's really a good thing.' One of the major goals of religion is to come up with some story that says death is really a good thing. It's not. It's a tragedy. And people think we're talking about a 95-year-old living for hundreds of years. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking radical life extension, radical life enhancement.""We are talking about making ourselves millions of times more intelligent and being able to have virtually reality environments which are as fantastic as our imagination.""Although possibly this is what Kurzweil's critics, such as the biologist PZ Myers, mean when they say that the problem with Kurzweil's theories is that ""it's a very bizarre mixture of ideas that are solid and good with ideas that are crazy. It's as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad."" Or Jaron Lanier, who calls him ""a genius"" but ""a product of a narcissistic age"".But then, it's Kurzweil's single-mindedness that's been the foundation of his success, that made him his first fortune when he was still a teenager, and that shows no sign of letting up. Do you think he'll live for ever, I ask Amy. ""I hope so,"" she says, which seems like a reasonable thing for an affectionate daughter to wish for. Still, I hope he does too. Because the future is almost here. And it looks like it's going to be quite a ride."

by Elisha Fieldstadt
 The American dentist who sparked international outrage after killing Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe has reached out to U.S. authorities, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials said Friday.  A representative for Dr. Walter James Palmer, who has admitted to killing the 13-year-old lion, ""voluntarily"" reached out to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement on Thursday, the service said in a statement.  Earlier Thursday, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe said efforts to contact Palmer had been unsuccessful and urged him on Twitter to get in touch.  Palmer has not been charged with a crime and has said he trusted his local guides to obtain necessary wildlife hunting permits. The guides face fines and jail time for alleged poaching and not having the proper permits.  Cecil was a popular draw for tourists and was tagged as part of a study at the U.K.'s Oxford University. Cecil's death has drawn international outrage.  In Zimbabwe, the illegal killing of a lion is punishable by a fine of $20,000 and up to a decade behind bars, and Zimbabwe's environment, water and climate minister said Friday that officials would appeal for the extradition of Palmer, who has since returned to the U.S.  Related: Cecil the Lion's Killer Should Be Extradited: Zimbabwe Minister  Back home, Palmer has been met with a wave of condemnation. Nearly 200,000 people have signed a petition on the WhiteHouse.gov website to have the dentist extradited.  Another petition seeks to retain the right to flood a Yelp page for Palmer's dental practice with negative reviews ‚Äî many of which have focused on outrage over Cecil's killing. The Change.org petition was started after Yelp removed many of the reviews. The petition had only been signed by 159 people as of Friday evening.  ""Yelp's autocratic censorship of this this historic, unprecedented outpouring of participation in public debate silenced and disempowered their loyal contributors,"" the petition reads.  A Yelp spokesperson said in a statement released to NBC News that ""media-fueled reviews typically violate our Content Guidelines. For example, reviews aren't the place for rants about a business's employment practices, political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.""  ""Our user support team ultimately removes reviews that violate these guidelines,"" the statement said. Yelpers: we hear you. http://t.co/SuHJG123Nd #CecilTheLion pic.twitter.com/DSBcuXYzHs Palmer shuttered the doors of his practice and disappeared from public view after word got out that he was responsible for the July 1 kill.

Slide:  1 / of  1.
Caption: 
Caption: Two Oxytricha cells mating.Robert Hammersmith Oxytricha trifallax lives in ponds all over the world. Under an electron microscope it looks like a football adorned with tassels. The tiny fringes are the cilia it uses to move around and gobble up algae. What makes Oxytricha unusual, however, is the crazy things it does with its DNA.Unlike humans and most other organisms on Earth, Oxytricha doesn‚Äôt have sex to increase its numbers. It has sex to reinvent itself.When its food is plentiful, Oxytricha reproduces by making imperfect clones of itself, much like a new plant can grow from a cutting. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre well fed, they won‚Äôt mate,‚Äù said Laura Landweber, a molecular biologist at Princeton University and lead author of a recent study on Oxytricha genetics. But when Oxytricha gets hungry or stressed, it goes looking for sex.When two cells come together (as in the image above), the ultimate result is: two cells. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve perfected the art of sex without reproduction,‚Äù Landweber said. The exterior of the two cells remains, but each cell swaps half of its genome with the other. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre entering into this pact where each one is going to be 50 percent transformed,‚Äù Landweber said. ‚ÄúThey emerge with a rejuvenated genome.‚ÄùIn size, Oxytricha‚Äôs genome is roughly comparable to ours. It has about 18,500 genes, compared to 20,000 or so for humans. But that‚Äôs one of the few things we have in common with this pond-dwelling protist.Unlike the cells of plants and animals (fungi too, for that matter), an Oxytricha cell has at least two nuclei. ‚ÄúYou can see them under the microscope if you stain for DNA,‚Äù Landweber said. One nucleus contains a working copy of the genome‚Äîall the DNA it uses to make the RNA and proteins essential for everyday life. Last year, Landweber‚Äôs team discovered that the DNA in Oxytricha‚Äôs working nucleus is partitioned into approximately 16,000 ‚Äúnanochromosomes,‚Äù most containing just a single gene. It‚Äôs a staggering number‚Äîmost common plants and animals have somewhere between a dozen and a hundred chromosomes (we humans have 23 pairs).In a recent paper in the journal Cell, Landweber and colleagues describe an even stranger arrangement in Oxytricha‚Äôs second nucleus, which contains the genes it will pass on to the next generation. In this nucleus, Oxytricha has about a hundred chromosomes, made up of a total of about 225,000 pieces of DNA. Tens of thousands of these pieces are encrypted: The letters of the genetic code are flipped or scrambled relative to the corresponding copy in the working nucleus.When two cells mate, each partner transfers a set of these chromosomes to the other. Then, each cell breaks the chromosomes down into their constituent 225,000 pieces and uses those pieces to assemble a new working genome, decrypting the encrypted pieces¬†along the way.‚ÄúIt really is like it‚Äôs running an algorithm, and it‚Äôs a cellular computer,‚Äù Landweber said.In the process of rebuilding its genome, which takes about 2 days, each cell discards more than 90 percent of its DNA to end up with a newly remodeled set of 16,000 nanochromosomes in its working nucleus. The final result for both cells is a new genome that incorporates pieces from its original stash of DNA as well as new pieces of DNA from its partner.It‚Äôs ‚Äúarguably the most complex genome architecture of any known eukaryote,‚Äù the scientists write. (Eukaryotes are cells with nuclei, which includes just about everything except bacteria).The reason for all this complexity is a mystery. One possibility, says Landweber, is that encrypting its DNA helps Oxytricha thwart viruses that might otherwise take up residence in its genome, she says. Or maybe its ability to scramble, unscramble, and rebuild its genome let Oxytricha and its ancestors create new genetic variations that helped them survive whatever hardships they‚Äôve encountered in their 2 billion years or more on Earth.Genetic variation is the engine of evolution, and it can come either from the slow build-up of mutations, or from the mixing and matching of parts that work together, Landweber says. Oxytricha is an extreme example of the latter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been drawn to these kinds of mathematical challenges in biological systems,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a problem of combinatorics and numbers. You have to understand coding and encryption to understand how all these pieces get put back together again.‚ÄùAnother possibility is that Oxytricha‚Äôs genetic complexity is less an adaptive trait than a legacy of its evolutionary past, says John Logsdon, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Iowa. Logsdon compares it to a bureaucracy. ‚ÄúThings happen, and then there are changes that get put into place to correct those things, and those corrections have a cost, so further corrections have to be made,‚Äù Logsdon said. ‚ÄúYou end up with this weirdly complex system that doesn‚Äôt make any sense on the surface.‚Äù""The tools can be hard to use, but even tech-phobic reporters have a responsibility to protect their sources"" bit.ly/2n8Vrra""The tools can be hard to use, but even tech-phobic reporters have a responsibility to protect their sources"" bit.ly/2n8VrraWe get it: Ads aren‚Äôt what you‚Äôre here for.

Infowars.com
September 26, 2013Intel Core vPro processors contain a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù 3G chip that allows remote disabling and backdoor access to any computer even when it is turned off.Although the technology has actually been around for a while, the attendant privacy concerns are only just being aired. The ‚Äúsecret‚Äù 3G chip that Intel added to its processors in 2011 caused little consternation until the NSA spying issue exploded earlier this year as a result of Edward Snowden‚Äôs revelations.In a¬†promotional video¬†for the technology, Intel brags that the chips actually offer enhanced security because they don‚Äôt require computers to be ‚Äúpowered on‚Äù and allow problems to be fixed remotely. The promo also highlights the ability for an administrator to shut down PCs remotely ‚Äúeven if the PC is not connected to the network,‚Äù as well as the ability to bypass hard drive encryption.‚ÄúIntel actually embedded the 3G radio chip in order to enable its Anti Theft 3.0 technology. And since that technology is found on every Core i3/i5/i7 CPU after Sandy Bridge, that means a lot of CPUs, not just new vPro, might have a secret 3G connection nobody knew about until now,‚Äùreports Softpedia.Jeff Marek, director of business client engineering for Intel,¬†acknowledged¬†that the company‚Äôs Sandy Bridge‚Äù microprocessor, which was released in 2011, had ‚Äúthe ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G.‚Äù‚ÄúCore vPro processors contain a second physical processor embedded within the main processor which has it‚Äôs own operating system embedded on the chip itself,‚Äù¬†writes Jim Stone. ‚ÄúAs long as the power supply is available and in working condition, it can be woken up by the Core vPro processor, which runs on the system‚Äôs phantom power and is able to quietly turn individual hardware components on and access anything on them.‚ÄùAlthough the technology is being promoted as a convenient way for IT experts to troubleshoot PC issues remotely, it also allows hackers or NSA snoops to view the entire contents of somebody‚Äôs hard drive, even when the power is off and the computer is not connected to a wi-fi network.It also allows third parties to remotely disable any computer via the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù 3G chip that is built into Intel‚Äôs Sandy Bridge processors. Webcams could also be remotely accessed.‚ÄúThis combination of hardware from Intel enables vPro access ports which operate independently of normal user operations,‚Äù¬†reports TG Daily. ‚ÄúThese include out-of-band communications (communications that exist outside of the scope of anything the machine might be doing through an OS or hypervisor), monitoring and altering of incoming and outgoing network traffic. In short, it operates covertly and snoops and potentially manipulates data.‚ÄùNot only does this represent a privacy nightmare, it also dramatically increases the risk of industrial espionage.The ability for third parties to have remote 3G access to PCs would also allow unwanted content to be placed on somebody‚Äôs hard drive, making it easier for intelligence agencies and corrupt law enforcement bodies to frame people.‚ÄúThe bottom line? The Core vPro processor is the end of any pretend privacy,‚Äù writes Stone. ‚ÄúIf you think encryption, Norton, or anything else is going to ensure your privacy, including never hooking up to the web at all, think again.

234,9243356,5 Tips to Grow 10-20% Faster Than Plan in ‚Äô15 ‚Äì SaaStr,http://www.saastr.com/5-tips-to-growing-10-20-faster-in-15/#.VQ2lvvcxa68.hackernews,2015,"Getting to Initial TractionJason LemkinIt‚Äôs time to do¬†a series of posts on SaaStr to sort of ‚Ä¶ kick your arse a bit. ¬†What I mean by that, is that no matter how well you are doing post-Initial Traction in SaaS ‚Ä¶ you can almost always do at least 10-15% better. ¬†Pretty much almost always. ¬†Because there‚Äôs almost always more you can optimize, if nothing else. ¬†I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy. ¬†It‚Äôs hard to get that last bit of growth out of the engine. ¬†But it almost always can be done if you force yourself to work even that much smarter and harder.And SaaS is tiring. ¬†There‚Äôs always some customer drama, some seemingly critical feature gap, some operations challenge, and the war for talent is endless. ¬†So it‚Äôs hard to dig even deeper inside yourself to get that last 10-15% of additional, much-harder-to-achieve revenue out of the ether.So I want to help. ¬†I want to challenge you to do Even Better in a series of posts. ¬†Because in recurring revenue, growing 10-15-20%+ more this year than even your stretch plan will pay huge dividends 3-4 years down the round. ¬†Because SaaS compounds.First up, Salesforce.com asked me to write 5 ideas on the topic. ¬†They recently published them here, and I‚Äôm republishing below.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîRecurring revenue businesses have pros and cons. One of the biggest cons is it‚Äôs just so hard to get to that first million in revenue. If you charge, say, $10 a month for your SaaS product, then just to get to $1 million in ARR (annual recurring revenues) ‚Ä¶ you need 8,000 paying customers!But once you finally get that engine going, it does get easier. Not only do the customers renew for the next year; they generally buy even more if you do right by them. And so once you get to even $3-$4 million in SaaS revenues, you pretty much become Unkillable, Unstoppable. If you do even just $3 million in SaaS revenues in ‚Äò15, the only question is if you do $4m or $6m or $10m in ‚Äò16. Because the vast majority of that ‚Äò15 revenue is going to recur.And what that means is, at least sometimes, a small amount of complacency can set in once you hit Initial Traction. Isn‚Äôt 60% growth, or 80%, or 120% enough for this year? I mean, that‚Äôs still great, isn‚Äôt it?Yes, of course that‚Äôs great. But because recurring revenue is so predictable once you get a few million in ARR under your belt, I want to give you a bit of a kick in the rear ‚Äî¬†and challenge you to do even better than your 2015 stretch plan.Because you can. Yes, in fact, everyone can.If you caught our Salesforce Live discussion with Parker Conrad of Zenefits a little while back, you heard the amazing story of a CEO and founder that in 2014 went from less than $1 million in ARR to more than $20 million, and from 1 to 100 sales team members. (Watch the video here.)But the best part of the story isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs that less than halfway through an amazing year of trying to do the amazing ‚Äî to go from $1 million to $10 million in 12 months ‚Äî Parker doubled the plan from $10 million to $20 million. You can hear the story here.Goodness. I know that‚Äôs not you. Zenefits is an outlier. Very, very few can go from $1 million to $10 million in 12 months, let alone $1 million to $20 million.But we all can do better than our current plans in SaaS. Here are 5 things you can do that will tilt your growth rate at least a bit higher:I hope you have a plan for MQLs (or whatever lead metric you use) this year. Maybe your plan is to grow your MQLs 120% so that you can grow your revenues 100%. Take a pause, and ask your VP of Marketing to do 20% better than that. And find a way to get her the capital. If you have a good sales team, more leads will drive more revenue, period. Don‚Äôt hesitate. Have the confidence to spend that incremental capital ‚Äî if your head of marketing is good.Most customer success teams are run and built on a ‚Äúbest efforts‚Äù basis. Their job is to keep the customers, to try to create net negative churn. That‚Äôs great, but put the team on a net revenue quota ‚Äî and give them at least 20% or more variable comp if they hit and exceed that quota. Magic happens when you provide the right economic incentives. Everyone works harder, and you see real results ‚Äî not excuses. You‚Äôre not going to grow your existing accounts as much as you could if your customer success team is merely paid on a best-efforts basis.Nick Mehta of Gainsight made this point well, as a key learning from his first SaaS company to his second. If you don‚Äôt constantly hire reps, you‚Äôll never grow the top line as fast as you could. You need to Always Be Hiring Sales Reps. Once you have an engine going, have faith. Have faith they‚Äôll generate and close the leads. And they will ‚Äî if they‚Äôre great. If your sales team is understaffed, you‚Äôll leave money on the table. A little overstaffed is better. Do that, and you‚Äôve got a chance to exceed your current plan.Your sales team needs help. They need to specialize. Your closers need to be closers. Your head of sales shouldn‚Äôt be doing marketing, or customer success, or anything else but sales. So if you don‚Äôt have a great VP of Marketing, hire one. If your prospects haven‚Äôt heard enough about your company, get on the road. Buy a billboard. Get better PR. Do more retargeting, more campaigns, more joint marketing. Build deeper partnerships. Do it all, or as much as you can, to give your team air cover. They‚Äôll close more deals this way, and they‚Äôll beat your plan. They need it. Are you doing the very best possible here? No. No one is. That‚Äôs why even Parker Conrad of Zenefits was on Salesforce Live, even with that amazing 2014. üôÇ Because he knew he could do even better by getting the word out even more, by providing more air cover.Most first-time CEOs (and many second-timers) like to hire up-and-comers, not veterans. That‚Äôs a great strategy. But sometimes, those early hires just don‚Äôt scale¬†‚Äî at least, not forever. I know you want to give them more time, more room to grow. You should. But if the time has come to top them with a boss ‚Äî a ‚Äúreal‚Äù VP of Sales, a CMO, a seasoned VP of Customer Success ‚Äî do it. Now. You‚Äôre not doing the business, or them, any favors by letting them stay in the top role longer than they can own it. If your head of sales can‚Äôt manage a larger sales team, you need to get a real VP of Sales in place right now. Wait ‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre leaving money on the table. Get the timing right here, and you can grow far faster in 2015.Try some of these initiatives. Each really will simply help you optimize the engine you already have. Make one piece of your business just 10-20% better‚Ä¶ well, in SaaS, that can have a profound effect.And as a CEO, challenge yourself. Get on a jet. Take that extra candidate meeting. Find that extra capital. Do whatever it takes to grow 20% faster than you would have this year. It won‚Äôt make a difference this month or next. But it will pay off in spades when you get to $100 million 20% faster, with less stress ‚Äî and more success.Great Post as always. Agree with all points and especially point 3 about never stop hiring sales reps. Ive seen the negative impact first hand on the top line, when hiring has stopped.Jason, can you share some best practices / ideas on how to design incentives / upsell quota for CS team to drive more upgrades? Some upgrades actually happen without any CS team involvement just because of the organic product expansions, how should this be accounted for?Usually, the simplest thing is just to hold the CS team to an overall net growth % for the installed base, e.g. 120% growth from base.  Then, however it happens ‚Äî it happens.  Some many be automatic.  Some may take a year of work.  The key it picking a clear, simple growth target from the installed base.  That will also implicitly include churn.Thanks, that makes sense.How do you reconcile the suggestion to ‚Äúalways hire more sales reps‚Äù with Aaron Ross‚Äô point that it‚Äôs more important to focus on reliable lead generation? In fact he says a common mistake is to hire too many sales reps too fast, before you have the lead generation rate to support it. For reference: http://www.insightsquared.com/2013/06/aaron-ross-how-predictable-revenue-drives-sales-growth/the point is less not hiring too many too fast, but more ‚Äî once you have a core group of reps that do perform ‚Ä¶ then you HAVE to hire them continuously thereafterMaybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding but Aaron‚Äôs point seemed to be the skill level of the sales rep is less a concern if you‚Äôre giving them good leads. And if you force the rep to prospect because there aren‚Äôt enough leads, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. I think lead generation is at least worth mentioning here, especially if you‚Äôre saying something like ‚Äúnever stop hiring sales reps.‚ÄùYour posts are excellent as they focus on the # 1 priority , sales and how to do it better.

235,8587279,A Viable MUNI Alternative in San Francisco?,http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/6258-crowdsourced-bus-lines-a-viable-muni-alternative,2014,"San Francisco appears to have an ongoing beef with every conceivable form of transportation available. Despite a nearly endless variety of options for ways to get us from A to point B, our geographical layout seems to demand increasingly new and better ways to get around. Haters and champions fight with equal fervor for and against ridesharing, bicycling, tech buses, Muni buses, BART trains, trolleys, Segways, private cars, carsharing, taxis, even walking. Well, perhaps it won‚Äôt solve all of our problems, but a ride sharing shuttle service called Chariot that emerged earlier this year to try and meet commuters in the transit battlefield is currently shuttling thousands to and from work.Chariot is essentially a shuttle bus service dedicated to creating new transit lines that commuters feel are desperately needed but not serviced by Muni buses or trains. The company proposes that instead of paying taxi/Uber prices, or transferring multiple bus lines, you pay $4 a ride (or $93 for a monthly pass) and catch one of their shuttle buses. Chariot‚Äôs efforts to run on-time shuttle buses at twice the price of Muni have been successful‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätheir marketing manager Lynn Tao told us that they have already recorded over 35,000 paid rides, with 2,000 rides a week between their first two routes, which run from the Marina to downtown, and from the Marina, Cow Hollow, and Pac Heights to SOMA/Caltrain.Their method of choosing new routes is pretty innovative. They use Tilt, a crowdsourcing website, to sell discounted monthly passes for a proposed new route through western SOMA. Once enough passes have been sold, the route is established. ‚ÄúWe think this is a great way to take the risk off our table and get the community involved in putting together better commuting options for themselves,‚Äù CEO Ali Vahabzadeh told TechCrunch. The only real caveat is that chariot users must buy a pass online beforehand and cannot simply hand over cash once on the shuttle‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoh, and there‚Äôs no mobile app yet (although they‚Äôre working on it).Although crowdfunding routes is a new idea, private bus lines were around back in the 1970s in San Francisco, via family run jitney lines which competed with Muni right up until Proposition K banned the resale of transit medallions in 1978. Only time will tell if Chariot can compete with Muni, which despite its slow speed, unreliability, colorful characters, and crowded nature, is overwhelmingly supported by San Francisco voters, who just approved a $500 million transportation (and road) improvement bond through Prop A.Via TechCrunch, photo by Charles Haynes/FlickrGot a tip for The Bold Italic?

Based on the following values:eBay CEO John Donahoe told shareholders at the annual meeting in San Jose, California,¬†yesterday that the company is ‚Äúactively considering‚Äù integrating bitcoin with PayPal.When asked by a shareholder about bitcoin‚Äôs potential role in global trade, Donahoe responded by saying that the digital currency ‚Äúwill play a very important role in the future‚Äù, eCommerce Bytes¬†reports.While Donahoe said he couldn‚Äôt envision exactly how bitcoin could become a more mainstream technology, he suggested that eBay is considering direct involvement with the digital currency, saying:‚ÄúExactly how that plays out, and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal, that's something we're actively considering. It's on our radar screen.""This is not the first time that Donahoe has commented on the company‚Äôs interest in bitcoin. Last year, the eBay CEO stated that a bitcoin payment option may eventually be added to PayPal.Yet the new statements are more positive than the ones made last year. In 2013, Donahoe said eBay was ‚Äúkind of thinking about‚Äù integrating bitcoin, suggesting that the company was investigating the digital currency:‚ÄúI‚Äôve been spending a lot of time looking at it and it‚Äôs truly fascinating. The way that the currency has been designed and the way inflation is built in to pay for miners and all of that is truly fascinating.Interestingly, Donahoe‚Äôs latest comments were made on behalf of the company, rather than from a personal perspective. It remains to be seen how ‚Äì and when ‚Äì eBay approaches the topic of bitcoin integration in the near future.Donahoe isn‚Äôt the only executive involved to voice his support for bitcoin. Last year, PayPal president David Marcus remarked that he is a fan of the digital currency and said that he, too, thinks a bitcoin option could one day be added.Despite not integrating bitcoin as a payment option, eBay has already seen some digital currency activity on its site.In early April, the online marketplace added a ‚ÄúVirtual Currency‚Äù category. The section allows users to buy and sell digital currencies, mining hardware and mining contracts.Notably, the company did not actively advertise the new category's addition, instead quietly modifying an existing section.eBay has also moved to create a new digital currency payment system, which would include bitcoin as one of several options, according to a patent application filed by the company in December 2011. It is also developing a digital wallet designed to hold multiple types of currency.Donahoe¬†image via WikipediaeBayPaymentsPayPal

243,7010967,Beware of Whois Verification Phishing Emails,http://www.domaininvesting.com/beware-whois-verification-phishing-emails/,2014,"I received a non-personalized email from GoDaddy this morning, and as I read it on my iPhone, I had an idea for a blog post about the importance of personalizing emails to customers. As I was reviewing my other emails, I received a subsequent email from a blog reader advising me of a possibly phishing scheme targeting domain name owners.According to a post on DNForum this morning from a user named Image Authors, there is an alleged phishing scheme targeting GoDaddy customers under the guise of a Whois verification requirement. I most likely received the same email since the information he shared about the underlying domain name looks to be the same. The subject of the email I received was ‚ÄúACTION REQUIRED ‚Äì Reminder to verify the accuracy of Whois data.‚ÄùWhen I receive emails from various websites and companies, I rarely (if ever) click the links, even if I know they are from the company. There‚Äôs too much risk with accidentally clicking a phishing email, and most issues that are addressed in various emails can easily be resolved by directly visiting the company‚Äôs website and navigating around that way.If you do happen to click on a phishing email by mistake and give your account information, log in to your account to re-secure it ASAP. You should probably contact the company directly to do that in order to ensure any transactions (like domain transfers) are stopped immediately.Check out the post on DNForum this morning, and beware of all emails that are supposedly from your domain registrar. It‚Äôs quite possible that a registrar email is legitimate, but why take the chance that it is a phishing email?I will probably still write my article about email personalization later on today, but this article is probably much more important and timely.
Rahul ChaudharyIt seems that the scammer is taking advantage of ICANN‚Äôs new rules that require domain registrants to verify the contact details.

	    FrancoisIt‚Äôs going to be a funky year!In one hand this new ICANN rule where if you do not verify your WHOIS account your domain should quickly be dropped. So registrars will feel obligated to multiply emails notices while domain owners should be more motivated to click verification links.In the other hand the multiplication of email phishing with the risk of stolen domains.
Joseph PetersonCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong here about something.The principal danger with this phishing scam, it seems to me, is that ICANN recently changed the rules to require whois email verification soon after domain registration.  Ineluctably, email verification requires clicking on some link in an email.  So even those of us who hesitate to click on email links, will be obliged to do so from time to time as a result of domain registrations.  Since this policy was only introduced in January 2014, even seasoned domainers will be unfamiliar with the process.  So I‚Äôd expect a higher-than-usual percentage of people to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù for this phisherman and betray their GoDaddy passwords.This phishing scam is actually quite sophisticated.  Apart from the graphics being a closely cloned version of GoDaddy‚Äôs, the landing page you‚Äôll see at the spurious GoDaddyAuthentication.com actually IS personalized with your name.  At least, it said ‚ÄúWelcome, Joseph‚Äù when I ventured there.According to Whois, the person behind this little operation just registered the domain I saw today.  But they‚Äôd obviously planned their approach in advance and specifically designed it to exploit the new ICANN policy.In case anybody was wondering, GoDaddy has already been notified about the issue.
Joseph PetersonThis just occurred to me while I was discussing this issue with Shane Cultra.It might be a good idea to click on these phishing emails just to see which phony domains they‚Äôre using to mimic registrars or other sites.  I‚Äôve only identified one shady domain: GoDaddyAuthentication.com.  But it‚Äôs quite possible that the same person will be using multiple such domains ‚Äî possibly under various pseudonyms and at different registrars.So if GoDaddy responds, once notified, by contacting the other registrar and shutting down the offending domain, then that‚Äôs still no guarantee that the same person (or someone else) isn‚Äôt perpetrating the same phishing scam with some other domain at another registrar.Personally, I expect phishing scams connected with this new ICANN policy to keep popping up.  Furthermore, I think email phishing will become a much bigger problem for the average consumer once phishers have access to more convincing domains based on the new GTLDs.  As domainers, I think we‚Äôll have to become more alert to phishing ‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs going to be one very ugly way the general public becomes acquainted with the use of domains.So please keep track of which domains are being used for such impostures.  And if you come across something not previously reported, report it to the company whose customers are may be defrauded.
Elliot SilverI received a second email shortly after the first one, but Gmail marked it as spam.It looks close enough to a real GoDaddy email that I bet many people fall for it. Hopefully they will see the DNF post or other posts on Domaining.com before they click through.Kudos to Francois from Domaining.com for sending out an email bulletin alerting people this morning.AcroThe legitimate email sent out by GoDaddy to verify your email address, as mandated by the new ICANN requirements, DOES NOT ASK YOU TO LOG IN.Obviously, this doesn‚Äôt mean that phishing emails that would employ another scheme won‚Äôt be generated.Keep in mind that if you verified that email address once, there won‚Äôt be another email from the same registrar. The first and only email, is sent out as soon as you registered that domain, in 2014 ‚Äì not hours or days later.And yes, the confirmation is required by the registrar and ICANN, so you cannot ignore the legitimate email without risking to lose the domain.

	    Where are the lawyers?ANOTHER MATTER FOR A CLASS ACTION HERE (add it to the class action against search engines running general TLDs different from their own trademarks and all the others class actions‚Ä¶).Conceal your data IS A RIGHT! Everyone can undesrstand EASILY the future plans of a company if he only follow the new domains they register‚Ä¶No one can ask for email verification WITHOUT setting before a new procedure for transferring domains without having to remove the privacy. It is a right giving fake registant data knowing that if you need to transfer a domain, and 90% of cases you need to do at least one transfer, you will have to remove the privacy.Why all the lawyers in this industry do not promote any of those class actions?!?!?‚Ä¶..
Elliot SilverWho do you think should be sued?

	    Where are the lawyer?I don‚Äôt know, this is the reason I am calling the lawyers‚Ä¶Anyway I am pretty sure that you will not be wrong suing ICANN and, of course, the GGGGGGreat master of all the plans to control the entire economy of the world and every single human being‚Ä¶Who will have access to those deep database? Maybe tax agencies of all the countries worldwide? Maybe. Surely I have a little bit presentiment that even the Great puppeteer will have access to them‚Ä¶

245,8581041,"Sex, Dating and the Expectations Trap",http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/11/04/sex-dating-the-expectations-trap/,2014,"Next StoryI was surfing around facebook one evening when I came across a comment by Berkeley‚Äôs ‚Äúradical philosopher‚Äù Benjamin Smythe. It was in response to a guy‚Äôs question about dating, and while I don‚Äôt remember the specific question, I do remember the gist of Ben‚Äôs answer:‚ÄúIf you are meant to have sex with her, the sex will happen, and if you are not, it won‚Äôt. So there‚Äôs no point in worrying about it.‚ÄùSo often when we go on a date, we don‚Äôt go empty handed, allowing the moment to unfold organically, however it unfolds. Rather, we come ‚Äúpre-packed,‚Äù with a head full of things we want and don‚Äôt want to happen. And so naturally when we are hoping for a certain outcome or experience and it doesn‚Äôt happen, we feel disappointed/let down, i.e., we suffer.Now compare that experience to going out with someone and simply going with the flow. You are genuinely open to whatever happens simply because you realize you have no idea what will happen! Why pre-judge (be prejudice toward) something if you haven‚Äôt experienced it yet? Besides setting yourself up for disappointment, oftentimes when we come with expectations, we give off a ‚Äúneedy‚Äù vibe that is usually a turn-off. It‚Äôs basically saying, I need you to be a certain way in order for me to be happy.Again, compare this vibe to going out with someone who seems happy and content naturally, and doesn‚Äôt need anything from you. I can tell you from personal experience that women are more attracted to men who are present and happy to be with them, than a guy who is focused on trying to get in their pants.And the first step to being present is to do less talking and more listening. Woman have told me that sometimes men will try to impress them with all their worldly accomplishments, but when it comes to being genuinely interested in their passions and interests, the men will turn the conversation back toward their own achievements‚Ä¶ as if they are trying to ‚Äúone up‚Äù the woman!?Another part of being a good listener is eye-contact. That‚Äôs why nothing kills a woman‚Äôs interest in a man faster than if she notices him looking at other women while they are out on a date. Bottom line: don‚Äôt do it.Finally, I‚Äôll share one last thing that I read in a comment section underneath an article on dating I read awhile back that I found very helpful. The commenter said that it wasn‚Äôt until he stopped ‚Äútrying‚Äù to find someone that he met his current girlfriend. That it wasn‚Äôt until he learned to be happy on his own that she came into his life, and not before.Those last three words really hit me: ‚ÄúAnd not before.‚Äù I remember reading that and realizing that he was right. That a part of me was ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù to be happy. In other words, I could feel that I had belief running somewhere that said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be happy unless I have a girlfriend.‚ÄùAnd so, instead of focusing on trying to ‚Äúget‚Äù someone, I made the decision to stop waiting to be happy and to just ‚Äúdo my thing‚Äù from a place of love and contentment. In other words, I discovered that the happiness and peace I had longed for was not in someone else, but inside me all along.Well, sure enough not long after this I did meet a woman, and we are currently happily dating. But, like the guy said in the comment section, it didn‚Äôt happen until I learned to be genuinely happy in my own skin."

It helps me know what features are desired or what bugs are causing the most pain.I have just one request; If you submit a pull request for a bugfix, please add a unit-test or integration-test (in the spec folder) that catches the problem.
 Even a PR that just has a failing test is fine - I can analyse what the test is doing and fix the code from that. The Workbook views controls how many separate windows Excel will open when viewing the workbook.Use the second parameter of the addWorksheet function to specify options for the worksheet.For Example:Worksheets support a property bucket to allow control over some features of the worksheet.Supported PropertiesSome new metrics have been added to Worksheet...All properties that can affect the printing of a sheet are held in a pageSetup object on the sheet.Supported pageSetup settingsExample Paper SizesWorksheets now support a list of views, that control how Excel presents the sheet:Each view also supports various properties:Frozen views support the following extra properties:Split views support the following extra properties:Individual cells (or multiple groups of cells) can have names assigned to them.
 The names can be used in formulas and data validation (and probably more).Cells can define what values are valid or not and provide prompting to the user to help guide them.Validation types can be one of the following:For types other than list or custom, the following operators affect the validation:Cells, Rows and Columns each support a rich set of styles and formats that affect how the cells are displayed.Styles are set by assigning the following properties:When a style is applied to a row or column, it will be applied to all currently existing cells in that row or column.
 Also, any new cell that is created will inherit its initial styles from the row and column it belongs to.If a cell's row and column both define a specific style (e.g. font), the cell will use the row style over the column style.
 However if the row and column define different styles (e.g. column.numFmt and row.font), the cell will inherit the font from the row and the numFmt from the column.Caveat: All the above properties (with the exception of numFmt, which is a string), are JS object structures.
 If the same style object is assigned to more than one spreadsheet entity, then each entity will share the same style object.
 If the style object is later modified before the spreadsheet is serialized, then all entities referencing that style object will be modified too.
 This behaviour is intended to prioritize performance by reducing the number of JS objects created.
 If you want the style objects to be independent, you will need to clone them before assigning them.
 Also, by default, when a document is read from file (or stream) if spreadsheet entities share similar styles, then they will reference the same style object too.Valid Alignment Property ValuesValid Border StylesValid Pattern TypesCaveatsUsing the interface above it may be possible to create gradient fill effects not possible using the XLSX editor program.
For example, Excel only supports angle gradients of 0, 45, 90 and 135.
Similarly the sequence of stops may also be limited by the UI with positions [0,1] or [0,0.5,1] as the only options.
Take care with this fill to be sure it is supported by the target XLSX viewers.Individual cells now support rich text or in-cell formatting.
 Rich text values can control the font properties of any number of sub-strings within the text value.
 See Fonts for a complete list of details on what font properties are supported.Excel supports outlining; where rows or columns can be expanded or collapsed depending on what level of detail the user wishes to view.Outline levels can be defined in column setup:Or directly on the row or columnThe sheet outline levels can be set on the worksheetNote: adjusting outline levels on rows or columns or the outline levels on the worksheet will incur a side effect of also modifying the collapsed property of all rows or columns affected by the property change. E.g.:The CSV parser uses fast-csv to read the CSV file.
 The options passed into the read functions above is also passed to fast-csv for parsing of the csv data.
 Please refer to the fast-csv README.md for details.Dates are parsed using the npm module moment.
 If no dateFormats are supplied, the following are used:The CSV parser uses fast-csv to write the CSV file.
 The options passed into the write functions above is also passed to fast-csv for writing the csv data.
 Please refer to the fast-csv README.md for details.Dates are formatted using the npm module moment.
 If no dateFormat is supplied, moment.ISO_8601 is used.The File I/O documented above requires that an entire workbook is built up in memory before the file can be written.
 While convenient, it can limit the size of the document due to the amount of memory required.A streaming writer (or reader) processes the workbook or worksheet data as it is generated,
 converting it into file form as it goes. Typically this is much more efficient on memory as the final
 memory footprint and even intermediate memory footprints are much more compact than with the document version,
 especially when you consider that the row and cell objects are disposed once they are committed.The interface to the streaming workbook and worksheet is almost the same as the document versions with a few minor practical differences:Note that it is possible to build the entire workbook without committing any rows.
 When the workbook is committed, all added worksheets (including all uncommitted rows) will be automatically committed.
 However in this case, little will have been gained over the Document version.The streaming XLSX writer is available in the ExcelJS.stream.xlsx namespace.The constructor takes an optional options object with the following fields:If neither stream nor filename is specified in the options, the workbook writer will create a StreamBuf object
 that will store the contents of the XLSX workbook in memory.
 This StreamBuf object, which can be accessed via the property workbook.stream, can be used to either
 access the bytes directly by stream.read() or to pipe the contents to another stream.In general, the interface to the streaming XLSX writer is the same as the Document workbook (and worksheets)
 described above, in fact the row, cell and style objects are the same.However there are some differences...ConstructionAs seen above, the WorkbookWriter will typically require the output stream or file to be specified in the constructor.Committing DataWhen a worksheet row is ready, it should be committed so that the row object and contents can be freed.
 Typically this would be done as each row is added...The reason the WorksheetWriter does not commit rows as they are added is to allow cells to be merged across rows:As each worksheet is completed, it must also be committed:To complete the XLSX document, the workbook must be committed. If any worksheet in a workbook are uncommitted,
 they will be committed automatically as part of the workbook commit.A portion of this library has been isolated and tested for use within a browser environment.Due to the streaming nature of the workbook reader and workbook writer, these have not been included.
Only the document based workbook may be used (see Create a Worbook for details).For example code using ExcelJS in the browser take a look at the spec/browser folder in the github repo.The following files are pre-bundled and included inside the dist folder.The following value types are supported.Every effort is made to make a good consistent interface that doesn't break through the versions but regrettably, now and then some things have to change for the greater good.The arguments in the callback function to Worksheet.eachRow have been swapped and changed; it was function(rowNumber,rowValues), now it is function(row, rowNumber) which gives it a look and feel more like the underscore (_.each) function and prioritises the row object over the row number.This function has changed from returning a sparse array of cell values to returning a Row object. This enables accessing row properties and will facilitate managing row styles and so on.The sparse array of cell values is still available via Worksheet.getRow(rowNumber).values;cell.styles renamed to cell.styleExcelJS now supports dependency injection for the promise library.
 You can restore Bluebird promises by including the following code in your module...Please note: I have tested ExcelJS with bluebird specifically (since up until recently this was the library it used).
 From the tests I have done it will not work with Q.If any splice operation affects a merged cell, the merge group will not be moved correctly"

Energy  drinks can cause heart problems according to research presented at ESC  Congress 2014 today by Professor Milou-Daniel Drici from France.
Professor  Drici said: ‚ÄúSo-called ‚Äòenergy drinks‚Äô are popular in dance clubs and  during physical exercise, with people sometimes consuming a number of  drinks one after the other. This situation can lead to a number of  adverse conditions including angina, cardiac arrhythmia (irregular  heartbeat) and even sudden death.‚Äù
He added:  ‚ÄúAround 96% of these drinks contain caffeine, with a typical 0.25 litre  can holding 2 espressos worth of caffeine. Caffeine is one of the most  potent agonists of the ryanodine receptors and leads to a massive  release of calcium within cardiac cells. This can cause arrhythmias, but  also has effects on the heart‚Äôs abilities to contract and to use  oxygen. In addition, 52% of drinks contain taurine, 33% have  glucuronolactone and two-thirds contain vitamins.‚ÄùDr  Drici continued: ‚ÄúIn 2008 energy drinks were granted marketing  authorisation in France. In 2009 this was accompanied by a national  nutritional surveillance scheme which required national health agencies  and regional centres to send information on spontaneously reported  adverse events to the A.N.S.E.S, the French agency for food safety.‚Äù
The  current study analysed adverse events reported to the agency between 1  January 2009 and 30 November 2012. Some 15 specialists including  cardiologists, psychiatrists, neurologists and physiologists contributed  to the investigation. The findings were compared to published data in  the scientific literature.The researchers found that consumption  of the 103 energy drinks in France increased by 30% between 2009 and  2011 up to over 30 million litres. The leading brand made up 40% of  energy drinks consumed. Two-thirds of drinks were consumed away from  home.During the two year period 257 cases were reported to the  agency, of which 212 provided sufficient information for food and drug  safety evaluation. The experts found that 95 of the reported adverse  events had cardiovascular symptoms, 74 psychiatric, and 57 neurological,  sometimes overlapping. Cardiac arrests and sudden or unexplained deaths  occurred at least in 8 cases, while 46 people had heart rhythm  disorders, 13 had angina and 3 had hypertension.
Dr  Drici said: ‚ÄúWe found that ‚Äòcaffeine syndrome‚Äô was the most common  problem, occurring in 60 people. It is characterised by a fast heart  rate (called tachycardia), tremor, anxiety and headache. Rare  but severe adverse events were also associated with these drinks, such  as sudden or unexplained death, arrhythmia and heart attack (myocardial  infarction). Our literature search confirmed that these conditions can  be related to consumption of energy drinks.‚ÄùHe added:  ‚ÄúPatients with cardiac conditions including catecholaminergic  arrhythmias, long QT syndrome and angina should be aware of the  potential danger of a large intake of caffeine, which is a stimulant  that can exacerbate their condition with possibly fatal consequences.‚ÄùDr  Drici continued: ‚ÄúThe general public need to know that so-called  ‚Äòenergy drinks‚Äô have absolutely no place during or after physical  exercise, as compared with other drinks designed for that purpose. When  used in long alcoholic cocktails, the caffeine in ‚Äòenergy drinks‚Äô  enables young people in dance clubs or elsewhere to overcome the  unwanted effects of alcohol, leading to an even greater intake of  caffeine.‚Äù
He concluded: ‚ÄúPatients rarely mention  consumption of energy drinks to their doctors unless they are asked.  Doctors should warn patients with cardiac conditions about the potential  dangers of these drinks and ask young people in particular whether they  consume such drinks on a regular basis or through binge drinking.‚ÄùAbout the European Society of Cardiology¬†The  ESC Congress is currently the world‚Äôs largest international congress in  cardiovascular medicine.¬† The spotlight of this year‚Äôs event is  ‚Äúinnovation and the heart‚Äù.¬† ESC Congress 2014 takes place from¬†30  August¬†to¬†3 September¬†at the Fira Gran Via in Barcelona, Spain.

248,8312279,‚ÄòInternet to be no longer a place where everyone has a voice‚Äô,http://rt.com/op-edge/186664-internet-slowdown-day-rally-fcc/,2014,"On May 15, 2014 the US
  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a plan that
  would enable Internet service providers to charge extra fees to
  content companies like Google for preferential treatment. Under
  these rules, big telecom companies like AT&T, Verizon and
  Comcast would be able to create a two-tiered Internet, with
  ‚Äúfast lanes"" for those who can afford it and ‚Äúslow
  lanes‚Äù for the rest. This is considered to be an attack on
  people‚Äôs rights to freely connect and communicate. Till now net
  neutrality remains the Internet‚Äôs guiding principle, which
  prevents discrimination. The advocates of this principle are
  calling on the FCC to reclassify Internet service providers
  (ISPs) as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 that would allow them to
  protect net neutrality by regulating against paid
  prioritization.RT:What is this planned reform and what's going to
  change?Liz
  McIntyre: Unfortunately, there are plans afoot by the
  FCC which would like to roll back Title II protections for the
  Internet, which means that they see a world in which the Internet
  is no longer a wonderful playing field where everyone has a
  voice. By rolling this back they would put the power over the
  Internet into the hands of a very small group of very powerful
  people, namely the telecommunications companies ‚Äì AT&T,
  Verizon, Comcast and of course the FCC. That could have serious
  implications for consumers.RT:How slow will online surfing be if your refuse to pay
  extra?LM:
  That is an interesting question. There are so many things that we
  do not know right now that we would like to know, and we are
  simply not getting answers. The vision is that when Title II
  protections are no longer there, then it will be up to the
  organizations in charge to decide exactly who gets what service
  and how fast this service will be. There is in vision a ‚Äúfast
  lane‚Äù for those who will pay an extra premium and a
  ‚Äúslow lane‚Äù for those, the average consumer, who is now
  in a pretty plain situation with all the big companies and
  everyone else, they have a voice just like the big companies
  do.RT:How could this affect the economy and businesses relying on
  fast access to online data?LM: It
  depends on in what business you are and how much money you have.
  If you have a lot of money and you are in the hip pocket of the
  FCC or anyone in Congress, perhaps you have a good relationship
  with one of the big telecom companies; you are going to have the
  fast access you want. And we foresee companies that are going to
  be using RFID tags, that are a layer on top of the Internet,
  probably get very fast speed, paying for extra fast speed, so
  that they could track, for example, RFID tags as they move around
  the world. But the average mom and pop who is trying to start an
  internet business on a shoestring, even some of the companies
  we‚Äôve come to know and love, companies like startpage.com, like
  private web search service; ETSY - great organization that allows
  people from around the world to produce products and sell them
  around the Internet; NameCheap ‚Äì a name registration service. I
  can go on and on with the companies that could be negatively
  affected by this and of course they are negatively affected by
  these companies that we love and we use. The consumers are the
  ones that are going to pay the price.RT:What's being done to stop the reform?LM:
  There is a very big movement afoot today here in the US and
  around the world actually, all gathering together for an Internet Slowdown Day. We want to let everyone in
  the world know what could possibly happen if Title II protections
  are rolled back. We want people to know that they could possibly
  lose fast or reasonable connections to the services they love and
  there is not really much they will be able to do about this. We
  want to let companies know, who may not yet know, how they can be
  affected, how they can be put out of business, shuttered,
  basically their websites could take forever to load, and who is
  going to wait around for a website to load? Of course the people
  with the money who are going to have fast load times to deliver
  their sales messages. Those people with the advantage over the
  other ones who will win in that world but most of the people on
  the planet, especially consumers, are poised to lose.RT:How close are corporations to the government body which
  regulates online issues?LM:
  Very close, it‚Äôs a revolving door basically of government
  officials from the FCC going out to private lobbying firms that
  work on behalf of the telecommunications companies. I have a list
  of those people, it is too many to even go through completely but
  I will tell you a prominent person in this whole struggle is Tom
  Wheeler, who is currently the Chairman at the FCC and he was
  appointed in 2014. Just an example of him alone is very
  troubling. Tom Wheeler is a former President of the NCTA
  (National Cable and Telecommunications Association); one of the
  organizations that are of course fighting for roll backs of Title
  II and loves the idea of ‚Äúfast lanes‚Äù and ‚Äúslow
  lanes.‚Äù He was also a former CEO of the CTIA (Cellular
  Telecommunications Internet Association), which is a wireless
  industry group also very interested in pushing through these
  ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúslow lanes‚Äù that are going to hurt
  consumers and small businesses.RT:Reports say many government employees leave for big
  companies. Isn't that a conflict of interest?LM: It
  is hard to believe in this day and age that this could possibly
  happen, that there has been such a close relationship among
  people, this is revolving door when they seem to be playing
  musical chairs just like when the music stops in a government
  agency and when the music starts again they roll around the ones
  in the lobbying group ‚Äì it is crazy. Approximately 70 percent of
  the lobbyists for the AT&T, Comcast and Verizon previously
  held government positions.RT:What particular actions do you plan to take? Why is it that
  important?LM: We
  take action, we let the FCC know, we let our representatives in
  Congress know, we let the US President know that we want the
  Internet, the free place for communications that it has become,
  the place that we have to rely on, has become a public square,
  become our place, where every man and every woman can be heard
  and they won‚Äôt be shut out, unlike in some other situations where
  people have very limited access. On the Internet everyone has an
  opportunity, everyone has a voice and every link right now is
  pretty much equal. So we need to fight back, we need to join
  together today and make sure we go to website sponsoring ways to
  contact representatives, battle for the net.com as one, fight for
  the future. Go there, voice your concerns! We can save the
  Internet if we are all together.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT."

'We got the call from the hospital and [the hospital staff member] was saying ""Oh Mark, look I just wanted to ring and let you know that Ben's actually started to come out of the coma""...and she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to say this...he's speaking Mandarin',"" Mark told Channel 10's The Project.'Neither of us can speak Mandarin so we just nodded but deep down quite concerned about what‚Äôs going on.'When he woke up, he was only able to speak fluent Mandarin - having only learned it at schoolThe 22-year-old along with his parents appeared on Channel Ten's The Project to tell his story  Despite taking Mandarin at school, Ben had never been fluent at the language.'I wasn‚Äôt consciously thinking I was speaking Mandarin, it was what just came out and it was what was most natural to me,' he said.It took Ben two or three more days to recall how to speak English.Since then, Ben's language skills have open new opportunities to him like leading Chinese tours of his hometown and hosting a Mandarin television program.Now the Melbourne man has moved to Shanghai to study commerce at university.He said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language.But what happened to Ben is not the first of its kind.His parents said they were baffled that he could speak Mandarin as neither of them spoke the Chinese languageHis new-found talent for the language led him to appear on a Mandarin television show and he now lives in Shanghai, studying commerceHe said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language   In 2010, a 13-year-old Croatian girl woke up had replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking German.More recently, a U.S. navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room and had no recollection of who he was and spoke fluent Swedish in July 2013.But a Queensland Brain Institute neuroscientist thinks he might have an explanation about what happened to Ben.Dr Pankaj Sah said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language, breathing, speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits.According to him, what possibly happened to Ben was that the parts of the brain that recalled English were damaged in the crash and those that retained Mandarin were activated when the 22-year-old woke up from his coma.

established in 2001 to empower users to control technology. To enable the
organisation to intensify its work with the European Commission and to let more
people know about Free Software, the FSFE needs another ‚Ç¨190,000 for its work
in 2015. Next year, the FSFE will push harder than ever to weave software
freedom into the fabric of our society.The new European Commission is currently setting the direction of its
policy making for the coming five years. The FSFE is in frequent contact with
Commission staff who currently see open doors for Free Software in Brussels.
In 2015, the FSFE wants to use this momentum to push for changes on software
procurement, standardisation, and device sovereignty, and create real progress
for Free Software and Open Standards.At the same time, in 2015 the FSFE will reach out to more people, and go to
more places where people do not yet know about Free Software. The FSFE will
expand its network of local groups throughout Europe. The organisation is
constantly translating its increasingly popular promotion materials
into many European languages. Local volunteers can spread the word about Free
Software by ordering gratis promotion packs, and distributing the materials at
libraries, cinemas, shops and in other places, greatly extending the reach of
the Free Software message.The best way to support the FSFE's work is to
become a Fellow (a sustaining member of the FSFE). All
Fellowship contributions directly benefit the FSFE‚Äôs work towards a free
society. Fellows receive a state-of-the-art 
Fellowship smartcard which, together with the free GnuPG encryption
software and a card reader, can be used to sign and encrypt e-mails, to secure
SSH keys, to securely log into a computer from a potentially insecure machine,
or to store the user‚Äôs hard disk encryption keys. Since the encryption key is
stored on the card itself, it is almost impossible to steal.There is also the option to make a 
one time donation to the FSFE.To continue its work in 2015, the FSFE will need ‚Ç¨420,000 in total. The
organisation has already secured ‚Ç¨230,000 thanks to existing sustaining
members, regular donations, and merchandise sales. The FSFE requires another
‚Ç¨190,000 to underwrite its work in 2015.Donate
      Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
      control technology.
    
      Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. It is important
      that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software
      gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software.
      These rights help support other fundamental rights like freedom of
      speech, freedom of press and privacy.

The images illustrate just how much a change in perspective can alter. It‚Äôs also worth noting that a few of these sites, like the Pyramids of Giza and the hotels in Dubai, were designed with an aerial perspective in mind. The designs of certain Dubai hotels can only be appreciated fully from above, and some theorize that the Pyramids of Giza were meant to be aligned with the stars in Orion‚Äôs Belt.Although¬†taking photographs from a bird‚Äôs actual perspective is possible, most photographers prefer taking pictures like these from hot-air balloons, helicopters, gliders, or very tall structures. A few of the photographs also seem to be taken from altitudes that even birds couldn‚Äôt reach. None of this, however, detracts from their epic beauty.Image credits: Aldas Kirvaitis

In
              an interview
              with IT Wire, Mark Shuttleworth argues that all
              copyright assignment systems are equal, saying further that what Intel,
              Canonical and other for-profit companies ask for in the process are the
              same things asked for by Free Software non-profit organizations like the
              Free Software Foundation.
I've written
                about this before, and
                recently quit
                using Ubuntu in part because of Canonical's assignment policies
                (which are, as Mark correctly points out, not that different from
                other for-profit company's assignment forms.)
However, it's quite disingenuous for companies to point to the long
              standing tradition of copyright assignment to the FSF as a justification
              for their own practices.  There are two key differences that people like
              Shuttleworth constantly gloss over or outright ignore:
            
FSF promises to never make their software
              proprietary.  Shuttleworth claims that All copyright
              assignment agreements empower dual licensing, and relicensing, but
              that is simply a false statement if you include FSF in the
              ‚ÄúAll‚Äù.  FSF promises to never proprietarize its versions of
              the software assigned to it and always release its versions of the
              software under Free Software licenses.
Non-profits have a different duty to the public.
              For-profit companies have one duty: to make money for their owners
              and/or shareholders.  Non-profit organizations, by contrast, are
              chartered to carry out the public good.  Therefore, they cannot
              liberally ignore what's in the public good just because it makes some
              money.  An organization like FSF, which has a public charter that
              explicitly says that it seeks to advance software freedom, would fail to
              carry out its public mission if it engaged in proprietary
              relicensing.

It seems that Mark Shuttleworth wants to confuse us about copyright
            assignment so we just start signing away our software.  In essence,
            companies try to bank on the goodwill created by the FSF copyright
            assignment process over the years to convince developers to give up their
            rights under GPL and hand over their hard work for virtually nothing in
            return.  We shouldn't give in.
I am not opposed to copyright assignment in the least, in fact, I
              support it in many cases.  However, without assurances that otherwise
              copylefted software won't be relicensed as proprietary software,
              developers should treat a copyright assignment process with maximum
              skepticism.  Furthermore, we should simply not tolerate attempts by
              for-profit companies to confuse the developer community by comparing as
              equals copyright assignment systems that are radically different in
              their intent, execution, and consequences.

256,10003337,All Possible Thoughts,http://pointersgonewild.com/2015/07/30/all-possible-thoughts/,2015,"electronics, neuroscience, originality, philosophy, thoughtsI‚Äôve recently been thinking about the topic of originality.¬†You‚Äôll often hear people say that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all been done before‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs old is new again‚Äù.¬†The world¬†population has recently passed¬†the 7 billion mark. According to some estimates, there have been up to 120 billion human beings alive since the dawn of humanity.¬†In a world so big, it‚Äôs hard to believe you‚Äôre unique.¬†It‚Äôs easy to feel irrelevant and worthless.¬†Some philosophers¬†have even tried to make the argument that all possible thoughts have been thought of before, leaving you no chance of ever coming up with anything original. After all, human beings have existed for hundreds of thousands of years, and if there‚Äôs been 120 billion of us so far, there‚Äôs been a lot of thinking going on.I think the best way to answer this question is with a thought experiment. We don‚Äôt know enough about neuroscience to exactly define what a ‚Äúthought‚Äù constitutes.¬†I‚Äôll make some simplifying assumptions to give us some chance to grasp at this problem.Let‚Äôs imagine that:In this imagined view, each thought is representable by a boolean vector of 512 bits, and any brain can have up to 1000 thoughts per second. In our imagined, simplified world, there are (2^512) ~=¬†1.34√ó10^154 possible thoughts in total.Using some back of the envelope math, assuming there have been 120 billion human beings alive so far, each living for 100 years, each having up to 1000 possible thoughts per second, this gives us:1000 * (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)¬†* 100¬†~=¬†3.2 * 10^12 thoughts per human being over a 100 year lifespan.Hence (120 * 10^9) * (3.2 * 10^12) =¬†3.84√ó10^23 thoughts happened so far, out of¬†1.34√ó10^154 possible thoughts.You might be wondering what the point of this was. My example is obviously ridiculous. Human thoughts likely¬†are not patterns of firings in a cluster of 512 neurons. We have tens of billions of neurons in our brains, each with thousands of synapses, and our neurons do not fire according to a synchronous clock like a modern silicon chip. Furthermore, each brain‚Äôs connectivity is uniquely affected by a combination of both environment and genetics, and hence, no two people have exactly the same neurons and synapses in the same place.The point is that the estimate of¬†1.34√ó10^154 possible thoughts is probably off by one hundred orders of magnitude. However, the estimate of¬†3.2 * 10^10 thoughts per year per human being may actually be generous.¬†Hence, I surmise that not every possible thought has been thought. Far from it.¬†The universe will likely dissipate before that has any chance of happening.From ‚Üí Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Life, CreativityReminds me of something I read years ago, which I can‚Äôt find a reference to now, unfortunately: around Beethoven‚Äôs time, a mathematician wrote a proof that music was almost all used up ‚Äì that there were very few possible melodies left.Of course, he was wrong. Which makes me believe that quantifying the number of possible melodies or thoughts isn‚Äôt really possible.Sorry I have no reference for this.Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

In this arti¬≠cle, we review and dis¬≠cuss best prac¬≠tices of the open source vol¬≠un¬≠teer¬≠ing and recruit¬≠ment process that suc¬≠cess¬≠ful project lead¬≠ers are using to lead their projects to suc¬≠cess. We com¬≠bine the per¬≠spec¬≠tive of the vol¬≠un¬≠teer, look¬≠ing at a project, with the per¬≠spec¬≠tive of a project lead¬≠er, look¬≠ing to find addi¬≠tion¬≠al vol¬≠un¬≠teers for the project.

258,9347882,Cookie Cutter Scaling,http://paulhammant.com/2011/11/29/cookie-cutter-scaling/,2015,"It is true that the industry generally no longer does vertical scaling - buying bigger and bigger boxes to host single deployments of nodes in a stack.  For many years, horizontal scaling has been the normal scaling technique. There is some variation in the implementations of that idea though. One particular style, where all horizontally scaled nodes are identical (which I‚Äôll call cookie cutter for the sake of this posting) pays dividends in terms of easy deployment and the ability to simply add boxes to add capacity to the stack.One common one for enterprises is to have a multi-tier architecture with TCP/IP separating each tier, and each horizontally scaled according to CPU load:Explanation: In the above, the observed (or estimated) CPU loads of the production environment drive the numbers of each node at each tier.  Assuming identical hardware for each process, it is easy to predict how many and where new hardware has to be added for a horizontal increase in capacity.  In the diagram above, to denote an intended capacity increase, I have two ghosted nodes at the W (Web) tier, and one ghosted node for each of the P and Q nodes (whatever they are).  In our diagram we model two ultimate backends.  They could be an big-bucks Oracle DB, ERP or legacy IBM mainframe.  They can add their own constraints like a max number of concurrent connections, that would affect everything I‚Äôm trying to sell here.When the production load on the stack is getting close to the maximums or starting to degrade capacity, then CPU percentage loads can be used as a way to work out which tier needs a new node to alleviate load (the shaded boxes in the diagram).  That, or some more complex analysis according to Amdahl‚Äôs law. With each deployment in one tier as opposed to another, there are configuration considerations.  Lastly, your architecture (and its configuration) might be able to suffer nodes being provisioned while the stack is up, or it might require being taken down totally (like the ‚ÄòApple store‚Äô today, though that might be because of mystique).The premise is that you compress up as many tiers into the top tier as possible.  Optimally into the same process, so you‚Äôre avoiding between-machine TCP/IP if you can. This assumes that you are using the same base technology in a relatively homogenous solution.  Corporate Java or .Net teams are used to that reality.  Quite often startups are not, as they‚Äôll use any technology that‚Äôs reasonable to get functionality live quickly. If you cannot get everything inside one process (one Java or .Net VM), then a localhost TCP/IP interface will suffice.Anyway, here‚Äôs a diagrammatic representation of the cookie cutter version of the previous architecture.Here we have W, P and Q in in one process.  The designers should have drunk the Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection kool-aid to allow a sane structuring of the components of this application, and to minimize the side effects of running multiple things concurrently in one virtual machine.  We‚Äôve eliminated some but not all of the downstream calls. With this design we still have to worry about timeouts and caching to a different degree.  Other things will become problems that were not before.  Specifically we have more classes in one VM (JVM or CLR for .Net) or now, and should worry about getting the memory allocations correctly.  Then there is the sidestepping all the TCP/IP formerly involved, as well as the implicit error handling or failover for outage.  We should also think about whether there is garbage collection that might have been workable before, but has tipped over a threshold since putting more in one JVM/CLR.  Perhaps also, there is dynamic class loading and implicit unloading that could cause the issues like they have for others in the past. The downside could also include reaching the constrains of the big or legacy back-end systems.  The mainframe may only be able to support a fixed number of concurrent connections.In some senses, this is moving ‚Äòfunctionality via remote services‚Äô, to ‚Äòfunctionality in an embeddable library‚Äô.  Whereas services can have their own release schedule, and the larger stack need not be deployed in lock-step, embeddable libraries are different.  Specifically, if there is a defect in the embeddable library version of the same thing, how quickly can all systems that use it be redeployed.  Is your deployment organization adept enough at rolling out upgrades, or are you 18 months at a time with the same release?We could consider that verifying Zipcodes or calculating Geo-ip data are candidates for external services, with elegant RESTful interfaces.  There would be a team around that of course, and it would get its own release schedule.  That would be a traditional enterprise solution right?  A sizing exercise would work out how many nodes were required in production, and the release engineers would get busy adding domain names and port numbers to configuration.  With the cookie cutter alternative, those two would be deployed in the same process as the things that would use them.  You would do some sums to determine whether the added data for each were was worth the cost.Actually Zipcodes and Geo-IP data are edge-case use in a typical stack.  I blogged before about Google Accounts, and maybe Google would do Geo-ip via a redirect on a missing or out of date cookie.  At least they are tangible examples though.From the deployer‚Äôs point of view, there are far fewer nodes types to think about.  If the stack has load-balancing (say F5) in front of the web tier, then registering new nodes with that is the only configuration ‚Äòchore‚Äô.   In terms of deployment at a pertinent go-live moment, and assuming humans are still involved (versus Continuous Delivery), a slider metaphor may be appropriate:Edging the slider to the right is a safer than an all or nothing flipping of a switch for a release.  Using the measured incidence of exceptions from the logs is a good way of gauging the success of the upgrade while 10% of the way in.  Of course whether your app is stateful or stateless has a bearing on whether this will work or not.  If it is stateful, F5 is going to try to keep people attached to instances hosting the old version.  You‚Äôre going to have to log session out periodically if their session is inactive, in order to free up nodes.  If you use Gmail, you notice that Google logs you our periodically.  Sometimes sooner than you‚Äôd expect, or two separate gmail accounts get logged out at the same time, and that could be correlated with a upgrade progression like this.  If the stack is stateless, then moving folks from one node to another mid-session is far easier. Although, that would only work for releases where there a few discernible differences between the old and the new.If you ignore CDNs and similar in-house solutions for static content, in terms of hardware you only have one set of machines. Each of those machines is either on one version or another.  With the other style of ‚Äúall upgrade at once‚Äù solutions, you will need two sets of machines, if you want to minimize downtime to seconds.From the developers point of view, there is a chance that they can bring up a larger chunk of the system on their own box.  Not only does this help a desk-check of the functionality that is about to be committed, but support folks are going to find it easier to attach an IDE for interactive debugging of issues they are trying to reproduce.  Sometimes dev boxes given out in enterprises are particularly powerful.  Anything to relieve the amount of resources needed for the processes needed to stand up the stack, would be a good thing.  Also, having the production configuration closer to the development config, is a good thing.  In a way, this is faithfully scaling the production architecture downwards, to an individual developer.While this blog entry promotes the simplicity aspects of deploying in a cookie cutter style, there are a couple of other things to think about.The designers of the reference multi-tier stack at the top, may have caching in place at any of the tiers to reduce the number of downstream calls. That could either be a separate cache per node because there is only a fixed set of relatively static data (refer to the traditional use of EhCache), or something in a Memcached style design that could support all of the nodes in the same tier.  This all amounts to a performance boost to the stack.  The suggested cookie-cutter solution can similarly benefit from caching.  Depending on the variable range of items being cached, and the numbers of keys, the same caching solutions can apply.It is true to say that each physically separated tier in a production stack can add latency to the end-user experience.  Caching, as mentioned, can reduce that, but only for transactions that are meaningfully cacheable.  What sort of figures can this amount to in a tuned production stack?  It can be as low as single-digit milliseconds per tier, and many would argue that this verging on insignificant.  What makes the TCP/IP multi-tier physically-separated machine style more complex in terms of design and deployment, is that care has to be taken with timeouts.  If the bottom most tier can handle timeouts appropriately, then a tier above that calls it should have a longer time out.  Or put another way, the closer to the client (browser) it gets, the longer the timeout should be.  Perhaps they should not be inordinately long.  Instead a sensible design should occur, with shorter and shorter timeouts towards the bottom of the stack.Once you have matched your development and deployment practices to the cookie cutter style, you are able to feel the benefits of provisioning interchangeable machines. Not only that, but the flexible resource allocation, automation of server management tasks, far fewer involved deployment engineers should provide additional (smug) comforts :)I‚Äôve blogged in and around this space for a few months:The Architectural meaning behind Google‚Äôs Accounts systemA forgotten aspect of the Facade PatternThe Five port rule for stack configurationCharles Haynes and Cosmin Stejerean for comments and fixes.¬© Paul Hammant 2002-2017.

259,9783045,Technology and Free Software in Tanzania,http://blog.mehl.mx/2015/technology-and-free-software-in-tz/,2015,"Thoughts about Politics, Free Software, Technology and nonrelated stuffAfter two months in Tanzania and in the computer education centre I work every day I learnt a lot about the culture of the locals in terms of their viewpoint on information technology. And in the same way I had to accept that my initial mental image of the people‚Äôs behaviour was (at least in parts) very wrong. So in this article I try to explain how I see the situation of modern technologies and the usage and understanding of Free Software in the region of Tanzania where I live.Free Software guarantees the full rights to use, study, share and improve it (but is not necessarily free of gratis). This sounds like something only interesting for IT specialists and nerds. But given the importance of software in our lifes one has to reconsider: Software controls our mobile phones, cars, air planes, heating systems, power plants, bank accounts and medical equipment. The one who controls this software is also the one who controls most parts of our lifes. Questions like ‚ÄûDoes all my data belong to someone else?‚Äú, ‚ÄûIs my data safe?‚Äú and ‚ÄûWho knows how much about me?‚Äú can only be answered when we start thinking about Free Software. By some people Free Software is also called Open Source. More about Free Software.Let‚Äôs start with a list of what I thought and what‚Äôs in fact the reality:Before I went to Tanzania it was quite clear to me that people here value Free Software quite much. This is because a lot of Free Software is also free of cost. Why should people use Windows, Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office when there‚Äôs also GNU/Linux, GIMP and LibreOffice/OpenOffice?‚ÄûFree Software? What is this and can I eat it?‚Äú It‚Äôs not that drastical though but the core message remains the same: The broad average population doesn‚Äôt know about Free Software and Open Source or even the applications I listed. When I gave a small workshop about GNU/Linux, noone of my students knew about it. But as we installed replacements of popular non-free software like LibreOffice, GIMP or VLC the questions marks in my students‚Äò heads became almost visible. Although they liked the idea of the whole world working on this software and that it‚Äôs for free, they asked me afterwards ‚Äû‚Ä¶and how can we install Microsoft Frontpage?‚Äú. This is the perfect time for misconception 2.‚ÄûFree Software is cool‚Äú. This is what I and many other people think. It takes power away from single and very large IT-companies to us, the users and small companies. It enables a free and fair market competition and can support our data privacy and civil rights protection in various ways. In western countries I can almost understand that there‚Äôre people who mistakenly think that only expensive products by big brands can be quality products. But in Africa? Never ever! The people are quite poor and why shouldn‚Äôt they value products which are for free and good?Apart from the fact that many people don‚Äôt know about alternatives to popular non-free software, they also cannot believe that something is for free. Many people here have arranged themselves with sharing illegal (and often virus-infested) copies of Windows and Microsoft Office. And especially in the rather ‚Äûrich‚Äú northern Tanzania, everything is about money. Asking to take a photo of a group of Maasai people in a nice background setting? 2000 Shilling. Somebody escorting you to a place you didn‚Äôt find? 500-1000 Shilling.However, I was able to convince my students that in the case of Free Software most software is really for free in terms of free beer but only after clear up many questions about it. The idea that something so valuable and created by so many people in so many working hours is really for free ‚Äì almost unbelievable, even for my local co-teachers.I‚Äôve been tinkering with computers and software since my youth when I reinstalled my operating systems at least once a month and started exploring the internet. I did this because I was interested in technology and wanted to explore its and my limits, but also because even back then I knew that IT will become more and more important and those who don‚Äôt understand it will rather be left behind.
I thought in Tanzania it‚Äôs a similar situation but somehow easier for the population. I thought that they have very limited technology here but that they know about the importance of computers and software in the industrial countries ‚Äì and it‚Äôs quite obvious that with several years delay they will reach the same level of IT-dependency than we have today. So I thought the people here would care about technology and will try to learn as much as possible about it to improve their career chances and catch up the industrial countries.(Disclaimer here: This is just my personal and at the moment very subjective view) It‚Äôs not that the people here are lazy and miss the future. They already have the future and it‚Äôs too much for them. Most of the Tanzanians in the city have a smartphone, some even have several. The mobile internet is partly better than in Germany, many companies already heavily depend on computers and I‚Äôm asked for my Facebook and WhatsApp contact details almost every day.The in some way funny thing is that they know all this (modern smartphone apps, newest iPhone‚Äôs details) but if they‚Äôre asked to download and install an application on their own Windows computer, even my IT-students reach their limits.That‚Äôs one of the questions I have in my mind every day. Why don‚Äôt they know about other software than the most popular (and even not best). Why do they refuse alternatives even if they just benefit their financial and infrastructural situation (no money, old computers, slow internet)? And why don‚Äôt they even know the most basic things but enjoy quite modern technologies?I assume it‚Äôs because of the very rapid and overwhelming change that the people here experienced. Before the smartphones they only had very old computers, mostly donated or from the trash bin of the industrial countries. While we already enjoyed internet, they had to linger around with ancient machines. And on these machines there was preinstalled Windows and maybe applications like Photoshop and Microsoft Office. It was almost impossible for them to download OpenOffice or GIMP because landline internet (ISDN, DSL) is very uncommon here.So they didn‚Äôt know about any alternatives and were happy to be able to use at least some applications. And here a second reason kicks in: How to learn to use a software properly? There‚Äôre almost no schools who teach usage of computers and their applications. And small companies cannot afford the expenses to train their employees in IT. So the limited supply of technology is further limited by the missing knowledge. As a side note: A volunteer friend of mine here told me that he fascinated his whole working place by showing the people that there‚Äôs something like =SUM() in Excel. Before that they wrote down long lists of numbers in Excel but calculated them by hand. It was a micro-finance organisation which lend small amounts of money to communities and single persons‚Ä¶And then, the smartphones came. And the companies offering mobile internet for affordable rates. People don‚Äôt rely on home computers and landline connections anymore but can chat and surf everywhere. They‚Äôre given the technology but not the knowledge. Although it works like a charm, many don‚Äôt know anything about it or how it works. When one of my students asked me how I learnt about web programming I showed him how to use internet search engines properly. He was stunned the whole day about sources of knowledge like wikibooks.org. And when I told the other student that apps on smartphones are just like programs on classic computers he asked where to find the Google Play Store on his Windows laptop.Tanzanians are not stupid and they‚Äôre not lazy. The students I referred to in this article are keen on learning new things and improving their lifes. However it‚Äôs hard to understand for first world people like me how they behave and think about many things. For me many people here are some kind of paralyzed by the rushing modern technologies coming from the industrialised nations without any education about it. So I still try to find a good way to teach my students and co-teachers the importance of computer and software knowledge as well as the benefits of Free Software.And as another important note: Not all Tanzanians are rather helpless when it comes to IT. I also met people who run very successfull IT businesses and some who know crazy software tricks which let my jaw drop to the ground. They somehow found a way to teach themselves although it‚Äôs very hard to do that here. I hope there will be more people of this type in the future. But for this, Tanzania need more and better education, more political support of IT schools, better infrastructure and better future perspectives for workers in IT businesses. Sounds like a harsh roadmap? It is‚Ä¶URL for this post : https://blog.mehl.mx/2015/technology-and-free-software-in-tz/Thanks for this interesting article, Max. For me the key sentence is: ‚ÄûThey‚Äôre given the technology but not the knowledge.‚Äú I can confirm this from other parts of the world.
And also there is the thing with the status symbols which are so damn important in many societies. I can imagine that people might even actively reject Free Software just because it doesn‚Äôt cost money hence it cannot act as a status symbol.Commentdocument.getElementById(""comment"").setAttribute( ""id"", ""5b8885853423bc54e59e2777ec172e4f"" );document.getElementById(""71b848ec1b"").setAttribute( ""id"", ""comment"" );Name(required)Email(required)Website

In the Harris poll, Walmart ranked 40th out of 60 total companies, toward the back of the pack with oil drillers and wireless carriers. YouGov only ranked the top 25 U.S. companies, and Walmart did not make that list. YouGov also broke down the five highest-rated discount retailers: Amazon topped that list, too, while Walmart did not appear.In fact, many people despise Walmart, and have for years, as a torrent of bad press has weighed on its public image. Walmart's bad rep began when it systematically squashed family-owned shops during its rapid national expansion in the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s. Since then, Walmart has endured a wave of lawsuits from workers accusing the retailer of gender discrimination, poor health care and wage theft.Amazon, on the other hand, is loved for the breadth of its inventory and the ease of using its website. People love its convenience. Yet the closer you look, the more Amazon begins to look like Walmart. Working conditions at the warehouses that make magical same-day delivery possible are starting to get scrutiny. In recent years, there have been media reports of warehouse workers fainting from heat exhaustion, with air-conditioning installed only many months later. Some U.S. employees are suing, claiming that they have not been paid for work or that Amazon employs tactics to avoid paying unemployment benefits. German colleagues went on strike over Christmas.And while Walmart crushed its smaller competition, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos can be just as ruthless against upstart online stores. According to the new book ""The Everything Store"" by Bloomberg Businessweek reporter Brad Stone, Bezos tried to buy Diapers.com in 2009. When rebuffed, Amazon warned the co-founders that it would get into the diaper business. Soon after, Amazon undercut Diapers.com's prices. When Walmart later made an offer to buy the site, Amazon reps warned the startup that Bezos ‚Äúwas such a furious competitor that he would drive diaper prices to zero if they sold to Bentonville.‚Äù Diapers.com sold to Amazon at the end of 2010.When reached for comment regarding the survey results, a Walmart spokesperson said that ""there are many different studies that measure brands,"" pointing out one from last year that concluded that Walmart was the most valuable retail brand in the U.S. But that study, from the New York-based consulting firm Interbrand, is based primarily on the company's financial data rather than customer surveys.""We offer great, full-time jobs for our employees,"" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Cheeseman told The Huffington Post. ""We are committed to providing not just competitive wages and comprehensive benefits, but also a network of support to ensure our employees succeed."" She said that warehouse workers employed by Amazon receive money toward college education and above-average pay and benefits for the retail sector. The shipping centers also employ seasonal workers from outside agencies who receive healthcare, but not Amazon's full set of benefits.Despite the Walmart parallels, how has Amazon kept itself in the good grace of the American public? For one, it dodged blowback from the National Security Agency spying scandal that engulfed major tech companies. Unlike Google, Microsoft, Facebook or Apple, Amazon was not implicated as cooperating with the NSA. Every other big Silicon Valley firm ""took a big perception nosedive,"" YouGov told Business Insider.And it helps that Bezos is apparently obsessed with avoiding the PR pitfalls of running a giant company. Again according to Stone's new book, the CEO once meticulously analyzed the characteristics that made some companies, like Apple and Nike, ""cool"" and other companies, like Microsoft and (yes) Walmart, not cool. Listing out his findings in a spreadsheet, he concluded that ""[d]efeating tiny guys is not cool.""   Amazon's warehouse horror scenes, which have started trickling out recently in local media reports, lawsuits and first-person accounts at Gawker, haven't yet taken root in the broader U.S. consciousness. ""The general press that impacts McDonald's and Walmart completely overshadows whatever press Amazon has received regarding its warehouses,"" Drew Kerr, a spokesperson for YouGov BrandIndex, explained. ""Amazon has not had an employee newsletter which has made the same mistakes the McDonald's one did, which made it a constant source of embarrassment. Walmart is the constant subject of class action lawsuits.""But more fundamental to Amazon's business model, its low-paid workers toil anonymously in massive warehouses (or as customer-service personnel or in Amazon's ""Mechanic Turk"" program, in which freelancers perform menial tasks online for pennies). Meanwhile, Walmart greeters wave to you as you enter the store. Shoppers are reminded of the human toll of ‚ÄúAlways Low Prices‚Äù whenever they visit a Walmart. But it‚Äôs harder to put a face to the ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button.This article has been updated with comment from Amazon after HuffPost initially did not receive one.Share this slide:

261,10155005,The First Commercially Available Car Navigation System Was from 1981,http://jalopnik.com/the-first-commercially-available-car-navigation-system-1574754802,2015,"The Global Positioning System constellation of satellites has been helping lost travelers find their way for a while now, but they only really started showing up in cars in the mid- to late- 1990s, and in big numbers even later than that. But the first automotive navigation system was offered over thirty years ago.AdvertisementIt was called the Honda Electro Gyro-Cator, and if you notice, I'm being very judicious in not calling it a ""GPS navigation system."" That's because it didn't rely on satellites, GPS or otherwise, to tell you where you were going at all. Rather, it was more like the inertial navigation systems used by fighter pilots in the Cold War.Inertial navigation systems are based on a pretty simple principle. If you know where you started, you know how far you travelled, and you know which direction you were headed in, then it should be easy to know where you are. Apply that concept continuously, and you've got the workings of a basic navigation system.AdvertisementThe challenge is in making that system accurate, durable, and actually knowing where you started to begin with.To make it accurate, Honda, along with Alpine and headlight maker Stanley Electric,  devised a system whereby a servo gear was hooked up to the transmission, so that the analog computer knew how far the car had gone. To know which direction the car was headed in, the system relied on a jet of helium gas, ran between two wires, to function as a gyroscope.If that all sounds very complicated, that's because a properly functioning gyro that can withstand knocks tends to be. And not only was it complicated in concept, but how could the system determine its starting point to begin with? Without that, you'd be lost. But the engineers at Honda had an idea:SponsoredThe suggestion was that the gyro's direction-sensing function could be used to guide a car if zero was constantly adjusted to the target road.The team began experimenting immediately. First, a map was drawn on a transparent sheet, then the target route was traced using a black, felt-tip marker. The objective of their experiment was to confirm whether the sensor could follow the route and guide the car. In fact, their initial results were highly encouraging. Subsequent experiments examined a more advanced idea, attempting to determine whether the sensor could pinpoint its own location according to road patterns and the car's direction of travel. This indeed became the starting point for important research, eventually leading to the world's first automotive navigation system: the Honda Electro Gyrocator.Yep, the idea was that simple. Take a plastic sheet, mark your starting point on it with a marker, and head off from there. If you overlay a map onto that plastic sheet, then you essentially have a navigation system. AdvertisementAdvertisementOkay, so it doesn't offer turn-by-turn directions, but it's better than nothing.To use the system, you'd just select a map out of your enormous binder of plastic maps, draw on it, like children and elementary school teachers with a love of overhead projectors do, shove it into the slot in your nav system, position it just right, make sure you're not off by 500 feet, and off you go. You would appear as a little blinking blip, with a trail of crumbs behind you, and you'd follow along on the map that you inserted to determine where you were.It was all in monochrome, of course, because it was the 1980s, and that was all people had on their computers. Either that, or everything being in one color was considered quite fashionable. I'm not sure, as it was the 1980s, and the whole world had gone a bit mad, style-wise. But it worked for Oregon Trail.AdvertisementYou can see how the marker-navigation system worked in the video below, along with a demonstration of the helium gyroscope. It really is all very intuitive once you see it in action:Also, it's possibly a lot easier to use than a lot of current navigation systems.AdvertisementHonda doesn't say how many cars they sold that were equipped with the Electro Gyro-Cator, but it couldn't have been very popular. It was offered as an option on the Honda Accord, and cost over $7,000 in 2014 money.And that was hugely expensive for some plastic maps. Nevermind all the complex inner workings.AdvertisementPhotos credit: Honda"

Because of this backlash, it seems that Wheeler is signaling an intention¬†to back down: The Wall Street Journal reports that the FCC is ‚Äúrevising proposed rules for regulating broadband Internet, including offering assurances that the agency won‚Äôt allow companies to segregate Web traffic into fast and slow lanes.‚ÄùHowever, just because Wheeler is signaling an intention to back down, that doesn‚Äôt mean that he actually is. The Journal‚Äôs sources say that Wheeler‚Äôs newest plan ‚Äúis sticking to the same basic approach but will include language that would make clear that the FCC will scrutinize the deals to make sure that the broadband providers don‚Äôt unfairly put non-paying companies‚Äô content at a disadvantage.‚ÄùIn other words, the new plan will still allow ISPs to strike deals with big players such as Google and Netflix to make sure that their content gets delivered on a fast lane while insisting that the FCC will have the right to make sure that these deals aren‚Äôt putting competitors at a disadvantage. Basically, this is the exact same endgame as the one¬†in Wheeler‚Äôs original plan, only this time he‚Äôs decided to add some more language¬†to assure¬†us that the plan really isn‚Äôt supposed to do what he‚Äôs designed¬†it to do.These¬†kinds of cosmetic changes that Wheeler will reportedly propose aren‚Äôt likely to quiet critics of the FCC‚Äôs plan, but it is interesting to see that he at least feels some need to pretend to cave to outside pressure.Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use"
263,8014952,Tesla Motors Inc Hiring Aggressively For Its Autonomous Car Project,http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/tesla-motors-autonomous-car-project/,2014,"Tesla Motors Inc¬†(NASDAQ:TSLA) announced¬†last week that the company will hire a large number of military veterans in coming years. Meanwhile, the company is quietly hiring a large number of experienced engineers from peer automakers, chipmakers, research institutes, universities, auto part companies, and internal transfers to work on its autonomous car project. That‚Äôs why Elon Musk so confidently stated in June that Tesla will make significant progress in autonomous driving within a year.Tesla Motors Inc¬†(NASDAQ:TSLA)¬†is working on an autonomous car, that‚Äôs no secret. The company reportedly tested it in Israel earlier this year. Elon Musk‚Äôs autonomous car strategy differs from Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)‚Äôs self-driving car. Tesla‚Äôs vehicle will still have a driver behind the wheel, but it can be put on ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù for a big part of the drive. In contrast, Google‚Äôs car won‚Äôt need a driver at all. Tesla‚Äôs approach seems more feasible from regulatory as well as technical perspective.According to uAutoInsurance, Tesla‚Äôs autonomous car initiative is currently in full-blown execution mode. Tesla hired Andrew Grey in October 2013 as Senior Engineering Manager from¬†Hyundai Motor Co (KRX:005380).¬†Ross Maguire, who previously worked as Assistant Manager-dynamics and performance test was transferred to¬†Autopilot & Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in December 2013.¬†Ashok Elluswamy, who previously worked at Volkswagen AG (ADR)¬†(OTCMKTS:VLKAY)¬†(ETR:VOW), joined Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot team in January this year.In February, Tesla Motors Inc¬†(NASDAQ:TSLA)¬†roped on¬†Jamie Carlson from Gentex Corporation¬†(NASDAQ:GNTX). In March, the San Francisco-based company transferred¬†Riccardo Biasini as Senior Controls Engineer for autonomous driving. That same month, the company brought in John Hopkins University robotics engineer¬†Christopher Brown. In May,¬†Darren Liccardo joined Tesla from BMW and¬†Adam Kilgore left GoPro Inc¬†(NASDAQ:GPRO) to work on Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot project.Last month, the Elon Musk-led company made three notable hires for its Autopilot project:¬†Hyunggi Cho from Carnegie Mellon University,¬†Akshay Joshi from Marvell Technology Group Ltd.¬†(NASDAQ:MRVL) and¬†Stefan Solyom from Volvo Car Corporation. That‚Äôs not all. Many of the company‚Äôs internal employees have been given added responsibilities around the autonomous driving on top of their prior responsibilities.Moreover, Tesla is still hiring for its ADAS team. As of July 3, 2014, there are still 11 open positions related to the autonomous driving project.Tesla shares gained 1.24% to $221.78 in early trading session Wednesday.Follow Us:Developed by ValueWalk TeamSponsored Content - Resource Center"

265,9676651,A First Class Degree from Oxbridge ‚Äì So What?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/julian-tan/oxbridge-oxford-cambridge_b_2108409.html,2015,"In my graduation gown and subfusc, I tensely stood before the vice chancellor of Oxford University. With both my parents proudly looking on, the dean of my college held up my hand as she led my graduating class through the ceremony. A few sentences in Latin later, we all solemnly declared, ""Do fidem!""As those two words echoed through the majestic 17th Century hall, we had all sworn an oath binding us to the university and its interests. We had graduated... I had graduated.Donning on my fur hood as confirmation and walking back into the hall to a raucous round of applause, I recalled with some strange fondness the difficult parts of my four years at that remarkable institution. From feeling deeply inadequate and undeserving to working and worrying relentlessly; every single bit of it was worth it at that moment. With the first class degree held tightly in my clutch, it was all worth it... Or was it?You see, I had graduated with first class honours from one of the best universities in the world and was even placed in the fourth percentile in my year, but at what cost?I often look back, as many people do, on my years at university and realise that there was so much opportunity back then that I failed to grasp; my vision clouded by my unwavering commitment to work.I wish I had:
-	Spent more term breaks travelling, not revising.
-	Said 'yes' to more nights out and meals with friends.
-	Ditched revision for my college ball despite it being two weeks before my final examination.
-	Slept more and spent more.
-	Worried less and complained less.
-	Made the time to meet new people and widen my circles.
-	Taken a step back from the chaos to truly appreciate how fortunate I was.Put simply, I wish I had worked less and played more. This is a piece of advice I dispense liberally to my undergraduate friends who during the middle of term, lament about their umpteen deadlines and unforgiving schedules. Life at university is about finding that balance between work and play. Indeed, mastering the art of doing this is a tricky and delicate affair, and very few people ever manage to do it. But quite honestly, very few people even try. Many, like me, get so thoroughly absorbed into the work at university that it is the only thing we see and value. We score brilliantly (or die trying) in the written exams and forget that academic results are not everything. University is a place of learning and learning takes place in all shapes and forms, often beyond the classroom.The people you meet, the contacts you make, the activities you do and the fun you have - all of them pay higher returns in both the present and the future than your textbooks ever will. So, to limit yourself to just the taught curriculum, as vast as it may be, is to severely short-change yourself of the true university experience. After all, the real final exam is not the one you sit for at the end of your course but the one you take the moment you leave (i.e.; the real world).Yes, of course a first at university is still undeniably valuable for what it is worth. It almost grants you an automatic pass from round one of job applications to round two. It attracts oohs and ahhs as your proud parents show you off to their friends. And perhaps most importantly, there is a tremendous amount of pride and satisfaction that comes with a first class degree.But also, a first class degree is to a certain extent just a number on a fancy (and expensive) sheet of paper. Self-development and academic success don't always come hand in hand. In fact, in some cases, they are mutually exclusive. Your worth and talent are not defined by this number. They are instead largely determined by your experiences in life. Entering the real world after the bubble that is university will expose this and you'll soon realise that not much separates a first and a 2:1 in an employer's eyes.I almost have a second chance to do it all over again with my postgraduate degree. But if you are in the position I was a few years ago, I hope you take a few steps back and put things in perspective. Study hard but play harder and make the most of your university experience.After all, what's the use of education in the classroom if it only prepares you... for the classroom?

266,7877035,Fundbox's Service-Based Infrastructure (Python),http://labs.fundbox.com/services-infrastructure/,2014,"
June 10, 2014 By    Ophir HorowitzHere at Fundbox, one of the first design decisions we made was to develop a service-based system. Our system is divided into several independent components (the services), each having a distinct logical role within the system. There are several advantages to this approach ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier to test each component independently, the overall system can scale more flexibly (as each component can be scaled separately), and code can be reused, which is always great.When we started designing the infrastructure for our service-based system, we had the following goals in mind:Business logic should be independent of the communication layer ‚Äì it should work with different kind of server frameworksImplementing the business logic should be as simple as possible ‚Äì when developing a new service, the effort should go to creating the business logic, not lengthy integrationsThe last goal was particularly important to us, as we didn‚Äôt know how well the server framework we chose initially will scale. So in case we needed to migrate to another framework in the future, code changes would be kept minimal. Several design iterations later, we got to the following implementation which works great for us. It‚Äôs written in Python, our core backend-development language, and we absolutely love it.Simple enough for you? It‚Äôs almost the most basic Python class you can write. Now, let‚Äôs look at the little tweaks:ExampleService inherits from ServiceBase ‚Äì that‚Äôs where the magic happens.ExampleService has a class attribute named CURRENT_API_VERSION ‚Äì allowing management of incremental API versionsExampleService‚Äôs methods are decorated with @expose_method ‚Äì which exposes them for public use by other services, as opposed to undecorated methods like _private_stuff, which can‚Äôt be accessed externallyThis design makes it very easy is to develop a new service or modify an existing one: the implementation is independent of the server and communication framework, and the class only contains the ‚Äúpure‚Äù business logic. Another benefit this has is that the logic can be tested independently of whichever server or communication framework is chosen. Simply create an ExampleService object and test it directly.Let‚Äôs dig in a little deeper and see how this is done:The decorator is fairly simple. It utilizes the fact that everything in python is an object, including methods. The decorator adds an attribute called exposed to the method it wraps:The ServiceBase class is used to decouple the service logic from the underlying framework ‚Äì the service code is independent of the framework used, and the framework doesn‚Äôt change based on which service it‚Äôs executing. Additional functionality can be added to all the services (like any parent class) ‚Äì a service heartbeat or error query, for example. The ServiceBase code is fairly simple:As you can see in run_method, we utilize the exposed attribute to discover if the method is public (After checking if the method exists). We return a tuple of success & result, which in the case of an error includes the error class and error message.In the next post we will go over the communication layer, the client side and error handling.

                    this is the exact concept from cherrypy‚Ä¶ why not use it instead of writing one?First off, great question! CherryPy is a great package, but as I wrote, one of our main goals at the time was not having to commit to using a specific web framework or communication layer. Although the end result may be similar, we couldn‚Äôt really easily use the CherryPy method exposing technique while keeping the option to have a different communication layer (for example, SOAP, which may be the protocol of choice for some of our business partners).Another advantage of this infrastructure is that there‚Äôs no parameter processing: In contrast, CherryPy mandates that you use string params only (which are translated to HTTP GET params), so when passing integers, lists or any other types, both the client side and server side need to include a serialization and de-serialization code. With our infrastructure, the communication layer is totally decoupled, and so floats, lists, dictionaries etc. can be passed with no pre or post processing. The infrastructure handles serialization of parameters, making the client and service code really nice and simple, focusing exclusively on the business logic. This will be made clearer in my next post.Also, as with probably any infrastructure, what‚Äôs presented here is the result of an evolution, and is not the full extent of our implementation. Our initial communication layer was implemented using Flask (SPOILER ALERT: we still use Flask for that), with decoupling happening afterwards.So, to conclude, although the final result would have been similar had we used CherryPy, keeping the flexibility and decoupling of business logic communication was more important to us.Ophir¬© 2014 Fundbox Lab Notes"

269,6669282,We‚Äôre About to Lose Net Neutrality ‚Äî And the Internet as We Know It,http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/so-the-internets-about-to-lose-its-net-neutrality/,2013,"""The tools can be hard to use, but even tech-phobic reporters have a responsibility to protect their sources"" bit.ly/2n8VrraNet neutrality is a dead man walking. The execution date isn‚Äôt set, but it could be days, or months (at best). And since net neutrality is the principle forbidding huge telecommunications companies from treating users, websites, or apps differently ‚Äî say, by letting some work better than others over their pipes ‚Äî the dead man walking isn‚Äôt some abstract or far-removed principle just for wonks: It affects the internet as we all know it.Once upon a time, companies like AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, and others declared a war on the internet‚Äôs foundational principle: that its networks should be ‚Äúneutral‚Äù and users don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to invent, create, communicate, broadcast, or share online. The neutral and level playing field provided by permissionless innovation has empowered all of us with the freedom to express ourselves and innovate online without having to seek the permission of a remote telecom executive.But today, that freedom won‚Äôt survive much longer if a federal court ‚Äî the second most powerful court in the nation behind the Supreme Court, the DC Circuit ‚Äî is set to strike down the nation‚Äôs net neutrality law, a rule adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 2010. Some will claim the new solution ‚Äúsplits the baby‚Äù in a way that somehow doesn‚Äôt kill net neutrality and so we should be grateful. But make no mistake: Despite eight years of public and political activism by multitudes fighting for freedom on the internet, a court decision may soon take it away.AboutMarvin Ammori¬†is a Future Tense Fellow at the New America Foundation and a lawyer who represents technology companies on internet policy issues. He is also the cofounder of a startup, Wearab.ly, which enables content to be distributed to wearable devices. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ammori serves on the boards of Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Engine Advocacy.¬†Fast Company¬†named him one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2012 for being Silicon Valley‚Äôs ‚Äúgo-to First Amendment guy‚Äù and one of the leaders of the campaign against SOPA and PIPA.How did we get here?The CEO of AT&T told an interviewer back in 2005 that he wanted to introduce a new business model to the internet: charging companies like Google and Yahoo! to reliably reach internet users on the AT&T network. Keep in mind that users already pay to access the internet and that Google and Yahoo! already pay other telecom companies ‚Äî often called backbone providers ‚Äî to connect to these internet users. [Disclosure: I have done legal work for several companies supporting network neutrality, including Google.]But AT&T wanted to add an additional toll, beyond what it already made from the internet. Shortly after that, a Verizon executive voiced agreement, hoping to end what he called tech companies‚Äô ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù. It turns out that around the same time, Comcast had begun secretly trialing services to block some of the web‚Äôs most popular applications that could pose a competitive threat to Comcast, such as BitTorrent.Yet the phone and cable companies tried to dress up their plans as a false compromise. Counterintuitively, they supported telecommunications legislation in 2006 that would authorize the FCC to stop phone and cable companies from blocking websites.There was a catch, however. The bills included an exception that swallowed the rule: the FCC would be unable to stop cable and phone companies from taxing innovators or providing worse service to some sites and better service to others. Since we know internet users tend to quit using a website or application if it loads even just a few seconds slower than a competitor‚Äôs version, this no-blocking rule would essentially have enabled the phone and cable companies to discriminate by picking website/app/platform winners and losers. (Congress would merely enact the loophole. Think of it as a safe harbor for discriminating online.)Luckily, consumer groups, technology companies, political leaders, and American citizens saw through the nonsense and rallied around a principle to preserve the internet‚Äôs openness. They advocated for one simple, necessary rule ‚Äî a nondiscrimination principle that became known as ‚Äúnetwork neutrality‚Äù. This principle would forbid phone and cable companies not only from blocking ‚Äî but also from discriminating between or entering in special business deals to the benefit of ‚Äî some sites over others.
	Unfortunately, the FCC decision that included the nondiscrimination rule still had major loopholes ‚Äî especially when it came to mobile networks.	
Both sides battled out the issues before Congress, federal agencies, and in several senate and presidential campaigns over the next five years. These fights culminated in the 2010 FCC decision that included the nondiscrimination rule.Unfortunately, the rule still had major loopholes ‚Äî especially when it came to mobile networks. It also was built, to some extent, on a shaky political foundation because the then-FCC chairman repeatedly folded when facing pressure. Still, the adopted rule was better than nothing, and it was a major advance over AT&T‚Äôs opening bid in 2005 of a no-blocking rule.As a result, Verizon took the FCC to court to void the 2010 FCC rule. Verizon went to court to attack the part of the rule forbidding them from discriminating among websites and applications; from setting up ‚Äî on what we once called the information superhighway ‚Äî the equivalents of tollbooths, fast lanes, and dirt roads.So that‚Äôs where we are today ‚Äî waiting for the second most powerful court in the nation, the DC Circuit, to rule in Verizon‚Äôs case. During the case‚Äôs oral argument, back in early September, corporate lobbyists, lawyers, financial analysts, and consumer advocates packed into the courtroom: some sitting, some standing, some relegated to an overflow room.Since then, everyone interested in internet freedom has been waiting for an opinion ‚Äî including everyday folks who search the web or share their thoughts in 140 characters; and including me, who argued the first (losing) network neutrality case before the DC Circuit in 2010.
	Web and mobile companies will live or die not on the merits of their technology, but on the deals they can strike with AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others.	
But, in their questions and statements during oral argument, the judges have made clear how they planned to rule ‚Äî for the phone and cable companies, not for those who use the internet. While the FCC has the power to impose the toothless ‚Äúno-blocking‚Äù rule (originally proposed by AT&T above), it does not (the court will say) have the power to impose the essential ‚Äúnondiscrimination‚Äù rule.It looks like we‚Äôll end up where AT&T initially began: a false compromise.The implications of such a decision would be profound. Web and mobile companies will live or die not on the merits of their technology and design, but on the deals they can strike with AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others. This means large phone and cable companies will be able to ‚Äúshakedown‚Äù startups and established companies in every sector, requiring payment for reliable service. In fact, during the oral argument in the current case, Verizon‚Äôs lawyer said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm authorized to state from my client today that but for these [FCC] rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.‚ÄùWait, it gets even worse. Pricing isn‚Äôt even a necessary forcing factor. Once the court voids the nondiscrimination rule, AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast will be able to deliver some sites and services more quickly and reliably than others for any reason. Whim. Envy. Ignorance. Competition. Vengeance. Whatever. Or, no reason at all.So what if you‚Äôve got a great new company, an amazing group of founders, a seat in a reputable accelerator program, great investors and mentors. With the permission-based innovation over ‚Äúour pipes‚Äù desired from the likes of Comcast, Verizon and AT&T‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no meritocracy here.Of course, despite everything the judges suggested during the two-hour argument, it‚Äôs possible that they offer net neutrality a reprieve. Given how sticky this morass is, there‚Äôs one simple way for you to judge the opinion: If the court throws out the non-discrimination rule, permission-less innovation on the internet as we know it is done. If the nondiscrimination rule miraculously survives, then, for now at least, so too will freedom on the internet.Editor: Sonal Chokshi @smc90""The tools can be hard to use, but even tech-phobic reporters have a responsibility to protect their sources"" bit.ly/2n8Vrra""The tools can be hard to use, but even tech-phobic reporters have a responsibility to protect their sources"" bit.ly/2n8VrraWe get it: Ads aren‚Äôt what you‚Äôre here for.

270,9173223,Raspberry Pi 2: Raspbian (ARMv6) V Linaro (ARMv7),http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20150308093946362/Raspbian-Linaro-Benchmarking.html#.VP3xpfRYzZg.hackernews,2015,"

News Stories






The Raspberry Pi Foundation make it pretty clear that
Raspbian is the recommended operating system for the
Raspberry Pi series of computers. Most of the Foundation's
documentation and support
directs users to Raspbian. The
downloads section of their website does list other operating
system images. But there are many more images
available, and one really piqued my curiosity; a Ubuntu 14.10 / Linaro
15.01 ""developer"" image. Unlike Raspbian, this image is compiled for
ARMv7/armhf.
But this ""developer"" image has no official support. It is not
supported by Linaro. Nor is it supported by the Raspberry Pi
Foundation; it's not even mentioned in the Downloads section
of their website. You see, the ""developer"" image is created by Toby
Wintermute,
a software developer who lives in Victoria, Australia. He claims that
this image should be quicker than Raspbian. Linaro is a not-for-profit engineering organization
consolidating and optimizing open source Linux software and tools for
the ARM
architecture. They focus on the ARM instruction set in its versions 7a
and 8, including the Cortex-A7 CPU. That's handy, as the Raspberry Pi 2
has a 900MHz quad-core M Cortex-A7 CPU.All of the tests have been performed on an unmodified
Raspberry Pi 2 running the latest builds of Raspbian and Ubuntu/Linaro.
Let's see if the ""developer"" image is faster than Raspbian.
SunSpider is a real world JavaScript benchmark that tests the core
JavaScript language. It is designed to compare different versions of
the same browser, and
different browsers to each other.The Epiphany web browser accessed in the repositories used by
the developer build of Ubuntu/Linaro was unable to complete the test.
It's badly broken. But in
Chromium, the Linaro image gives a significantly better
score.
For full benchmark results for each test click on these
links: Raspbian
- Epiphany , Raspbian
- Chromium, and Linaro
- Chromium.
Google Octane is another benchmark for measuring a
JavaScript's engine performance. It runs a suite of tests
representative of today¬ís complex and demanding web applications, with
the latest verion
measuring garbage collection / compiler latency and
asm.js-style JavaScript performance. Linaro's Octane score in Chromium of 1540 far exceeds
Raspbian's 401. Epiphany is broken in Linaro so the test wouldn't
complete. In Raspbian, Epiphany obtained an Octane Score of 327.
NBench is a single core synthetic computing benchmark
which tests both integer performance and floating point performance.

The Raspbian image scores 20.141 in the integer index, and 8.630 in the
floating-point index. With the Linaro image, the scores are 20.956 and
8.047 respectively. Raspian is therefore stronger in the floating-point
index, but weaker in the integer index. Full results are available in
the screenshots below.UnixBench is another popular synthetic indicator of
the
performance of a Unix-like system. This test handles multi-CPU systems,
and gives an overall system benchmark.

With the test running 4 parallel
copies of tests, the Raspberry Pi 2 under Raspbian scores system
benchmarks index score of 435.1. Under the Ubuntu/Linaro build, the
score is a near identical 433.3.When running 1 parallel copy of tests, Raspbian's system
benchmarks index score is 170.1; 166.8 under Ubuntu/Linaro. Again, the
difference is statistically insignificant.HardInfo acts both as a system profiler and benchmark. Here
are the results of HardInfo's benchmarks.For all of the tests above with the exception of CPU
Cryptohash, lower figures are better. Bear in mind that these tests
only use a single core. Again, it's a mixed bag of results.GtkPerfIt is difficult to draw any real conclusions from GtkPerf,
except that Raspbian is slightly slower overall running this set of
tests.SysBench is a multi-threaded benchmark tool for testing CPU
performance, memory allocation, file I/O performance and more.With Raspbian, the CPU test with only a single core and
all four cores executes in 298 and 74.5 seconds respectively. With the
Ubuntu/Linaro build, the scores are 320 and 79.8 respectively. Raspbian
wins this contest.Next Page: Software

271,8792950,Net Neutrality at Stake in India; Airtel Starts Charging for VoIP Data [Updated],http://techpp.com/2014/12/24/net-neutrality-stake-india-airtel-starts-charging-voip-data/,2014,"
						Next time you make a voice call using Skype or Viber using 2G or 3G data on Airtel, you'll be paying premium rates outside of your monthly data plan.					
                                Next time you make a voice call using Skype or Viber using 2G or 3G data on Airtel, you'll be paying premium rates outside of your monthly data plan.                            We are pretty sure not many would have even heard about Net Neutrality in India, but it‚Äôs high time that it becomes a hot discussion. Bharti Airtel, India‚Äôs largest telecom provider has silently started charging standard data rates for VoIP data usage on all Internet data packs and plans. This means Airtel subscribers who have subscribed for some 2G or 3G data packs will be charged additional rates when making VoIP calls.As per the new data policy which is hidden under fine print,All Internet/data packs or plans (through which customer can avail discounted rate) shall only be valid for internet browsing and will exclude VoIP (Both incoming/ Outgoing). VoIP over data connectivity would be charged at standard data rates of 4p / 10 KB (3G service) and 10p / 10 KB (2G service).Henceforth, customers will be charged at 4 paisa per 10KB on 3G and 10 paisa per 10KB on 2G when they make voice calls using services like Skype, Viber, Google Hangouts etc. WhatsApp is rumored to start providing free voice calling feature soon. Internet data includes voice data, video data and text data, but never before a carrier has dared to charge extra for one of the types alone.



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Net Neutrality is a hot topic across the globe. In the US, there‚Äôs a proposal to provide fast-lanes for premium service providers like Netflix and Hulu who‚Äôll be paying premium rates to the data providers in order to provide seamless service to their customers. US government including Barack Obama has voiced displeasure over such arrangements which puts Net Neutrality at stake.
What Airtel has done breaks the basic premise of Net Neutrality. It is true that voice calls take considerably higher bandwidth than text data, but it‚Äôs not like Indians pay dirt cheap prices for data. Instead of investing more on improving the infrastructure, one of the largest telecom carriers is indulging in dirty games. It‚Äôs not long before others like Vodafone, Idea and Aircel adapt a similar policy, unless TRAI jumps in. In the past we have seen that the carriers had proposed to charge connectivity fee for ‚ÄòOver-the-Top players‚Äô like WhatsApp and Viber which was thrashed by TRAI. Instead, Airtel is charging the customers for the same.
What‚Äôs next? Charging extra for streaming music or watching YouTube videos? Mind you, VoIP calls in India is at a nascent stage, but video streaming has already picked up. This can only be a start to what we will see in the near future, unless curbed right away.
Update: We had reached out to Airtel and this is what they had to say ‚Äì 
We have made some revisions in the composition of our data packs, and will offer VoIP (Voice over internet protocol) connectivity through an independent pack that will be launched shortly. Our customers can continue enjoying voice calls over data connectivity by opting for this VoIP pack, or simply use VoIP services on pay-as-you-go basis.
Now this is interesting. They will have a separate data pack for voice calls. And what next? A separate data pack for video streaming? A separate data pack for music streaming? This is completely anti-net neutrality. 
Update 2: Union Telecom minister, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad has clarified that the government will look into the matter and will get back with a structured response.
Update 3: Airtel details its new VoIP exclusive Data plans.
Update 4: Airtel has rolled back the proposed VoIP plans as TRAI has set up a consultation to reign in OTT players.

Here's what happened when we got our hands on a slow-motion camera [x-post from /r/cardistry] (youtube.com)submitted 1 year ago by visualmadness[‚Äì]Z3tsubou 508 points509 points510 points 1 year ago¬†(124 children)How do you make a living with shuffling cards?[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 752 points753 points754 points 1 year ago¬†(116 children)Cardistry is a pretty knacky skill to pick up, so my friends and I create instructional videos teaching people how to handle cards like we do. Most of the basic stuff we teach for free, and the more advanced material we sell on our website.In addition to that, we also design and produce our own playing cards, which are the ones we use in this video. It's kind of a nifty loop in the sense that people who watch our videos first get curious about our cards and end up buying them, while people who find out about our cards first eventually want to learn how to do cardistry with them, which leads them back to our tutorials.Either way, it's entirely centered around the art of cardistry, and so we depend on being adept practitioners of it in order to maintain our livelihood.Hope that answers your question! :)[‚Äì]MakesYouSeemRacist 58 points59 points60 points 1 year ago¬†(13 children)Hold on, you guys are owners of Virtuoso?[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 69 points70 points71 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Yup! That's us.[‚Äì]x-rainy 88 points89 points90 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)i just realized your youtube videos is where my young cousin learns how to do ""magic with cards"", as i call it. ('cause watching this shit is magical) he's all into shuffling the cards in crazy ways and making it look cool. i just remembered he posted one of your videos on facebook a while back. he's getting pretty good at it, too! just thought you might want to know that your videos are reaching and inspiring people all over the world. my cousin and i are from croatia. :) [+][deleted] 1 year ago¬†(2 children)[deleted][‚Äì]UnicornFritters 28 points29 points30 points 1 year ago¬†(8 children)Hopefully not being too intrusive with this question, but is it a viable source of income?[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 200 points201 points202 points 1 year ago¬†(7 children)As you can guess it's a very niche artform, so we aren't leaking hunnits out of gold-plated sweatpants or anything. But it does get us by well enough so that we don't have to worry about money, which frees us up to focus on our content.[‚Äì]lostinfont 73 points74 points75 points 1 year ago¬†(5 children)Have a gold-plated comment then. ;) You made me laugh and your skills are mesmerizing. I could watch you guys for hours. [‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 77 points78 points79 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)Wow! Totally did not expect that at all. Thanks so much for the gold, man ‚Äî really appreciate it. In between this and all the positive comments from reddit, you guys have totally made my day![‚Äì]YepThatAlejo 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)I was unimpressed by all the dicks on the youtube comments. You guys have great skills. I'm glad you get to make a living off of it.
Cheers![‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Thanks man! Really appreciate your positivity in the midst of some of the cynicism out there.[‚Äì]mwiegel2 10 points11 points12 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Man, I so jealous of you guys haha. You found a niche talent(which is badass by the way) and was able to capitalize on it. Great job.[‚Äì]Konfliction 93 points94 points95 points 1 year ago¬†(8 children)Was expecting to hear ""dealer"" lol didn't expect that, nice lol[‚Äì]MTandBJJ 25 points26 points27 points 1 year ago¬†(6 children)I'd still wager that he deals a little blackjack on the weekends. [‚Äì]moiez326 12 points13 points14 points 1 year ago¬†(5 children)I'll bet you're right but i don't know if i'll take the risk. [‚Äì]thatguy0900 9 points10 points11 points 1 year ago¬†(3 children)Most gamblers wouldnt play with a dealer like him. If he can shuffle like that he can probably stack the deck with little issue. Any losing streak is going to be blamed on him[‚Äì]scissor_running 8 points9 points10 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Best to hold, then[‚Äì]SoulLover33 8 points9 points10 points 1 year ago¬†(7 children)I might be a bit late, but I've never been more impressed and jealous of someone's skill. I'll definitively look into the tutorials you guys have made. Also a question: is there anything special about the cards you guys sell? Material wise.[‚Äì]ZShep 63 points64 points65 points 1 year ago¬†(5 children)There is something special about cards that are used for cardistry - quickest put they tend to be made by the USPCC (US Playing Card Company).There are several properties that you look for in such cards, which are some balance of:For very specific tasks, there are some types of card that are very good. If you're focusing on cuts or throws, a lot of store bought cards are very clumpy and stick together well. There are special super-thin cards usually used by magicians for routines involving lots of palming cards. There are plastic cards that are extremely durable and so can be good for practice.But all things considered, it's pretty much universally agreed that USPCC produces cards that are a very good balance of these characteristics. Good skill will offset most problems of course, but their cards make life a lot easier, especially for fanning.Within USPCC cards there is some variance. The most common brand is ""bicycle"" which are extremely good cards. There are two other main families of card they create (where the material of the card is different), named ""tally-ho"" and ""bee"". Tally-ho's tend to be more durable and will fan better for longer. Bees are more similar to what you'd find in a casino - they are thicker and clump a little bit more but are more durable.Reasonably new to the scene are cards with custom backs that are designed by people and then produced by USPCC. These tend to be very popular on Kickstarter. The vast majority of the time, the cards are made from the same material as Bicycle cards, and rarely they are made from a high-tier version of the same cardstock (which is graded when it's produced). Rarely, they are made from the other materials.Some of the higher-quality cardistry groups make decks through USPCC with more overt differences, although in general the changes are only really noticeable once you have a bit of knowledge in the area. Almost all cardists will practice with a deck of Bicycles, which are reasonably cheap (I can buy 12 for about $20), and will survive a lot of practicing with cuts and a fair amount of fanning before they start clumping.For performances, a magician will almost always use Bicycles because they look more ""legitimate"", whereas cardists will tend to use pretty decks.[‚Äì]meticoolous 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)Thank you for taking the time to explain that. Really.[‚Äì]ZShep 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)I'm glad to help. Cardistry as a hobby helped me deal with some health concerns I had, so it holds a soft spot in my heart. It's really cool to see people interested in it.[‚Äì]AjBlue7 41 points42 points43 points 1 year ago¬†(20 children)Your deck is so sexy. For real though, if you are looking to make some real bank, you should pitch to a couple casinos. Figure out a deal with your manufacturer so you have a decent margin, and then offer to teach the dealers how to flourish for free, so long as the casino buys your cards. Its so perfect, because not only doesn't the casino get to create a new attraction for their casino, but it doesn't cost them anything, since they were paying for cards anyway. On top of that, you would probably only need to spend a couple months teaching the dealers, as your successful students will take over and teach the new employees, and the casino could probably have a wage incentive for dealers that learn cardistry. I'd pitch it as hibachi for casinos. You got to be careful with your contracts though, the last thing you want is an exclusivity/non compete deal with a casino that stops buying your cards. Pump out an exclusive design for the casinos and your in business.Once the ball gets rolling you don't have to do much to keep the money flowing in. [‚Äì]QNTRL 35 points36 points37 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Not sure about america but here in australia that probably wouldnt work out. Casino are very strict about how cards are handled. In cardistry with all the flourishes and flicks its easy to lose a card or just lose track of it. If the guys watching the cameras cant see all the cards in play at all times they get very upset as it leaves room for colusion and cheating against the house which is a huge no no. [‚Äì]distinctgore 7 points8 points9 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Yep, it's in the casinos best interest to make shuffling and card dealing as transparent as possible. The multitude of cameras pointing on each table is not just to catch people cheating the casino, but also to ensure any claim made against the casino (dealer) can be easily reviewed.[‚Äì]d4m4s74 29 points30 points31 points 1 year ago¬†(13 children)The problem is that casinos make most money of addicts. And they don't want flashy or entertaining dealers. They want fast dealers.[‚Äì]Bamcfp 15 points16 points17 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)This isn't all true. While they do want fast dealers (we had certain time/quality limits for our shuffling and dealing)  they don't want us doing fancy shit cause it makes it harder for the camera guys in security to keep track of our cards.Also they don't want addicts and actively try to help them. A lot of gambling addicts have serious problems and are depressing as hell to have at a table and drive customers away, that's not what they want.[‚Äì]AjBlue7 6 points7 points8 points 1 year ago¬†(11 children)I thought they made the most money off of whales.[‚Äì][deleted] 12 points13 points14 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Nice to see you guys playing your cards right.[‚Äì][deleted] 14 points15 points16 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)The cards were beautiful & the video was amazing! The blue queen was cool.[‚Äì]nxtzen 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)great video but I have to ask what shoes those are[‚Äì]Plasticover 6 points7 points8 points 1 year ago¬†(9 children)I want a deck like the one in your video. Where can I get that?[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 16 points17 points18 points 1 year ago¬†(8 children)Hey! We'll be selling this version of our deck soon on our website.[‚Äì]mirulezs 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Do you ship to Malaysia? I would love to buy it![‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)We do![‚Äì]mirulezs 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Alright! Thank you.[‚Äì]amfoejaoiem 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Awesome!To everyone worried about losing jobs due to technology: take note. This is the new economy. Get really good at a random skill like card shuffling and you can get enough views on your videos / sales of merch to make a living. Don't complain that technology is replacing jobs (it has been doing that since someone used a rock to kill a gazelle, reducing the number of 'hunter' jobs required) - use it to your advantage to create something new! This is a business that requires youtube, ecommerce, etc and I think it's awesome to see people figuring out how to leverage tech to create something people want and make money doing it. Kudos.[‚Äì]TomorrowByStorm 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Did you design the cards to accentuate your hand movements? There are some tricks in there where I would not have known what was going on without the coloring of the cards. Great design. [‚Äì]Zarii 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Interesting, as someone who used to be a lot into card and is self thought on a few shuffles, slight of hand and tricks etc the first thing I thought was 'what are those cards?' so your loop is working flawlessly as I'll be ordering a deck now and whilst trying to get back into it I will mots likely check out your content so yeah :D [‚Äì]Tempered_Traps 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Dude, you guys make playing with cards cool! Seriously, I feel so old fashioned and boring after watching that video[‚Äì][deleted] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Great job on the card design too, it really pops when spinning. [‚Äì]Heisenberger_ 27 points28 points29 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Advertisements on reddit is a start.

I don't want to see a card flying through the air in slow motion, I want to see all of the crazy dexterity.[‚Äì][deleted] 122 points123 points124 points 1 year ago¬†(27 children)I like this onehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_M_aRtX-bA[‚Äì]Tanya3 73 points74 points75 points 1 year ago¬†(10 children)I just spent 5mins watching card tricks on my phone while sitting on a toilet and my only thought was, ""Man, my life will never be this cool.""[‚Äì]Maxxxz1994 17 points18 points19 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Omg i too am on the toilet.

Waste of a slow motion camera.[‚Äì]Forever_Awkward 51 points52 points53 points 1 year ago¬†(6 children)The super fast hand motions and crazy shuffles are more impressive when they're fast. They want to look good, not sate our curiosity.[‚Äì]KarmasAHarshMistress 15 points16 points17 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)Why not both?[‚Äì]Forever_Awkward 17 points18 points19 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)Because it's an advertisement. If you slow down the bits where the impressiveness comes from the fast movement, then you suddenly have a cool video that shows people how to move their hands to do these things. That makes for a good video, but a bad advertisement. The goal is to impress people into paying to learn the tricks and buy the stylized cards. Slowing down the cards going through the air makes the tricks more impressive-looking and shows off the cards at the same time.[‚Äì]Splitlimes 8 points9 points10 points 1 year ago¬†(7 children)Check out this video from the /r/cardistry sidebar, it sounds like what you're after.[‚Äì]Agehn 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)Was that OP's card backs that made it to the quarter finals?[‚Äì]Splitlimes 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)Yep it is, the virts have made several decks, but that was the first edition which used different colours. [‚Äì]recoverybelow 60 points61 points62 points 1 year ago¬†(8 children)exactly, why slow down the most boring parts?[‚Äì]cygnae 38 points39 points40 points 1 year ago¬†(6 children)so you pay to learn how to do the awesome parts.

We're still determining a good pricing point for the cards themselves, and should be announcing it on our site in the upcoming week.Our previous, decks often go for anywhere between $30‚Äî$70 per deck on eBay these days, but as you know that's mostly just because they're sold out and people always want what they can't have. Suffice it to say, our new decks will be much more affordable than that when they come out![‚Äì]Tyrannosaurus_flex 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(3 children)Do you ship worldwide?

Blurring it even further would just make the hand motion seem even more suggestive, so that was out of the picture too. And re-shooting it wasn't even an option, because rental costs for a slo-mo cam is definitely not anywhere near cheap these days.So in the end we decided, 'You know what? As long as it keeps people watching, they can post all the dick jokes they want.'[‚Äì]Hetziness 6 points7 points8 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)I'm glad you kept it, the first clip looks so cool with the slowmotion. I didn't notice the suggestiveness in it till after it was pointed out.[‚Äì][deleted] 10 points11 points12 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)shuffling cards for a living, that's awesome[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 24 points25 points26 points 1 year ago¬†(3 children)It is, man! It's definitely an unconventional job, but it's one I wouldn't trade for the world.By far the best part, though, is how many friends you make through the art, worldwide. You can literally go to any country in the world, and you'll feel at home with people who also do cardistry, regardless of skill level or style. Like a good friend once told me, 'cards are the best passport in the world' :)[‚Äì]djmizzy94115 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)So my friend... what is it with you and cards?Good to see that the Virts are still leading the way in cardistry! Used to practice for hours when I was in school. This was the last thing I expected to see on the frontpage of Reddit, what a nostalgia trip.Keep it up, buddy![‚Äì]sweetfrown 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)Do you guys have the same size hands?[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 7 points8 points9 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Yup! All our hands are about the same size. And they're not super huge or anything... all the cardistry you see in the video is just the result of over 10+ years of practice.[‚Äì]lyricalsaint 23 points24 points25 points 1 year ago*¬†(10 children)Shit, I need my wife's help just to do a basic shuffle for me every time its my turn to deal. This is just insane.EDIT: Being uncoordinated with shuffling cards is apparently ""beta"" now a days.[‚Äì]Makast 38 points39 points40 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)dope[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 21 points22 points23 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Thanks![‚Äì]regalrecaller 29 points30 points31 points 1 year ago¬†(6 children)Okay, redo this video but do it with Magic the Gathering cards. In any case, y'all have talent.[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 47 points48 points49 points 1 year ago¬†(5 children)Funny thing is, our friend /u/RyujiChua did just that for the MtG Grand Prix teaser! You can watch him do some aerials with an MtG deck below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ix79DnGvFEAlso, thanks for the kind words man, really appreciate it :)[‚Äì]jjness 10 points11 points12 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)That's sweet! That promo made me try a few things with magic cards. I'm not nearly dexterous enough :([‚Äì]ReplysToYourComment 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Its all about practice man, its unbelevable the time and energy these guys sink into their art.[‚Äì]heaveninherarms 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Oh my god you have no idea how many times I've seen that video. It may have even hit a hundred times.I watch a lot of Channel Fireball videos + keep up with tournament magic.[‚Äì]jruhlman09 6 points7 points8 points 1 year ago¬†(4 children)And here I though I was cool being able to cut the deck with one hand a couple of different ways :S.Awesome stuff.[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 7 points8 points9 points 1 year ago¬†(3 children)Nice! Which one-handed cuts do you do? Those are always fun to practice when you're mouse-surfing the web or watching a movie.[‚Äì]jruhlman09 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)Looking at your website, one of them was the Charlier cut. I'm not sure of a name for the other one, but I start off with the deck held between by middle and index finger. Then I use my thumb to rotate the top half of the deck out around my index finger so that I have a half of the deck on either side of my index finger. I then tuck the half of the deck that was on top under the other half and bring the two halves back together. Something like that.Edit: It might be the spin cut or tilt-and-swap? Similar to this[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)The mechanics you describe are very similar to that of the Knuckle Cut, just with a different starting grip. Either way, it's a great finger-stretcher, and definitely a very useful move to have in any card handler's repertoire.[‚Äì]doubledipset 51 points52 points53 points 1 year ago¬†(8 children)You're extremely talented and I would love to see more! It's a shame the video was edited so painfully. I had to struggle to continue watching because I wanted to see the full visual beauty of your performance without stuttering cuts driving me crazy. It felt like a tease that left me blue balled and upset. [‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 23 points24 points25 points 1 year ago*¬†(7 children)Thank you... I guess?But seriously, we appreciate the feedback and the kind words about the flourishes in the video. Regarding the editing, we try and match the look of the video to the feel of the music, so the 'glitching' in the video is meant to create the same vibe that the soundtrack by The Flashbulb evokes.We do agree, though, that a more 'unplugged' performance video showcasing moves in full would be great as well, and it's actually something we'll be looking to put out later this year. Once, y'know, we're not so busy with our upcoming deck launch! Haha.[‚Äì]shawster 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)The editing worked for me. Nicely done.[‚Äì]ffollett 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Maybe you could get together with the Slowmo Guys of youtube?  You, presumably, wouldn't have to pay for a camera rental then, and you could do a more 'unplugged' performance as you said.  That's kinda their forte, shooting videos like that.  And being put up on their channel would expose your group to a whole new demographic.Then again, I don't see cardistry getting messy or explodey, which all of their videos seem to do at some point.[‚Äì]doubledipset 7 points8 points9 points 1 year ago¬†(2 children)I get where you're coming from, I like the track, and I LOVE what you're doing. I'll probably be picking up a deck too (and use it for not-so-impressive things like card games). If my comment was too hurtful, please vent all that pain by continuing to accomplish awesome feats and producing positive and inspiring content ;)[‚Äì]visualmadness[S] 5 points6 points7 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)Not at all man! We're always open to constructive feedback. It's always good to hear about how the art is perceived from a public standpoint, as it informs us as to how we can make it more accessible for people who are new to cardistry.Also, thanks for the support in advance! And card games can be impressive as well... though mostly it's when you win. Haha.[‚Äì]matt_shifted 13 points14 points15 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)Just to offer a bit of counterpoint to this I thought the glitchy editing and music worked really well together and made a nice cohesive theme. I think you would have to totally switch up the style if you changed the music.I'm a fan of glitchy / IDM stuff though so take from that what you will.[‚Äì]Ralanost 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)I will second to what /u/doubledipset said.  The cuts made the video distractingly annoying.  There are other ways to sync a video with music that doesn't make the video hard to watch.  Different song, planning your shuffling with the song in mind or any number of other tricks.[‚Äì]aggibridges 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)I thought the editing was fantastic. It was artistic rather than utilitarian, and really contributed to my enjoyment of your work. Will be looking to buy some of these decks if only for decoration :)[‚Äì]fptp01 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)i think you confused youtube and vimeo.[‚Äì]AoutivD 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(11 children)Kevin?!?!?!?[‚Äì]bearded_martha[üç∞] 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(6 children)Many of these moves are considered ""flourishes"" where cards can be shown off in a complex way yet still remain in the same order as initially presented. This is probably a loose definition though. Dan and Dave are other excellent examples of this art that have always stood out in my mind. These guys seemed to have really stepped up their game![‚Äì]stwjester[üç∞] 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(0 children)In your nightly poker game, Do you all try to stack the deck whilst shuffling? I imagine this would be a really interesting side game, since you all know how to manipulate cards... Get caught stacking by someone, you pay them a rounds worth of blinds, if they call you out and you were being legit, they pay you... etc. Awesome video, stellar manipulation, great deck, and very smart from a business standpoint to post here. You probably have already seen a nice little boost in traffic directly from reddit.[‚Äì]w33z 4 points5 points6 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)TIL there's a subreddit dedicated to non-magical, artistic manipulation of playing cards[‚Äì]Vamathar 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago¬†(1 child)How did you do that shuffle at 0:46, that was crazy![‚Äì]bibimbapYourWorld 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago*¬†(0 children)this is hell of a commercial for playing cards.

Informed news analysis every weekdayUse commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.The biggest problem with Healthcare.gov seems simple enough: It was built by people who are apparently far more familiar with government cronyism than they are with IT.That's one of the insights that can be gleaned from the work done by the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on government transparency. In a report filed this past week, the group examined why the system broke as horribly as it did: The contracts awarded to those who built it were, by and large, existing government contractors with ""deep political pockets.""""All but one of of the 47 contractors who won contracts to carry out work on the Affordable Care Act worked for the government prior to its passage,"" the report reads. Some of the names ought to be familiar: Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton, all of whom assumed different roles and worked on different aspects of the project.As familiar as those names might be, especially to those who follow Beltway lobbying practices, few of them would be as commonly associated with large-scale IT projects as, say, Google, Amazon.com, or Dell would be -- especially when it came to building the public-facing components of the system. (Techdirt concurs.)Why did they get the work? The report hints at a likely reason: The companies were big lobbyists, with ""some 17 contract winners reported spending more than $128 million on lobbying in 2011 and 2012."" Granted, some experience with government work is vital for any contractor, and the federal procurement system is geared to favor those already doing government work, but Sunlight pointed out that the list tips heavily toward those with both existing contracts and political leverage.The most central name in the list of contractors, and the one most closely identified with the outward failure of Healthcare.gov, is CGI Federal, which the Sunlight Foundation describes as ""a longtime provider of IT services to the federal government."" Most of CGI Federal's previous work centered around technology services for Medicare and Medicaid. According to the New York Times, CGI Federal claimed many problems stemmed from the way the government itself managed the process, including the in-house coordination of the project between subcontractors rather than having a separate contractor do the coordination itself.All the same, CGI Federal -- which received $88 million for its work since March of this year -- told Congress in September it was indeed ready for the onslaught of users that would come when Healthcare.gov opened to the public. The same was claimed by UnitedHeath subsidiary Quality Software Services, another partner in the project that received $55 million for its work.One other name in particular on the contractor list probably won't be familiar to readers, but ought to be from now on: Science Applications International Corp., or SAIC. Nominally a defense contractor, SAIC has been involved with many government projects with ghastly end results, such as New York City's fraud- and corruption-riddled $600 million CityTime payroll software boondoggle. When the East Bay Express reported on Oakand, Calif.'s surveillance plan, it was worried about SAIC's involvement in that project as well, not least because the people hiring SAIC for the job seemed unaware of the company's reputation.SAIC's exact involvement in Healthcare.gov is difficult to determine, in part because a lot of details about who worked on precisely what portions of the project have been hard to come by. The Sunlight Foundation report indicates SAIC had ""contracts with the Internal Revenue Service ... for supporting income and family verification procedures required by the health care law.""It also doesn't help that many of the organizations involved are now distancing themselves from the whole project, which seems wise given the scale of this disaster. Compare that attitude with the pride many of them exhibited before Healthcare.gov went online, which was being trumpeted as a marvel of cutting-edge Web engineering. Now it's shaping up to be more an example of the efficacy of political connectedness.This article, ""How federal cronies built -- and botched -- Healthcare.gov,"" was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

          Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.
        Hydra is a distributed data processing and storage system originally
developed at AddThis. It ingests streams of
data (think log files) and builds trees that are aggregates,
summaries, or transformations of the data. These trees can be used by
humans to explore (tiny queries), as part of a machine learning
pipeline (big queries), or to support live consoles on websites (lots
of queries).You can run hydra from the command line to slice and dice that Apache
access log you have sitting around (or that gargantuan csv file). Or
if terabytes per day is your cup of tea run a Hydra Cluster that
supports your job with resource sharing, job management, distributed
backups, data partitioning, and efficient bulk file transfer.The Hydra Documentation Page
contains concepts, tutorials, guides, and the web api.The Hydra User Reference
is built automatically from the source code and contains reference material
on hydra's configurable job components.Getting Started With Hydra
is a blog post that contains a nice self-contained introduction to hydra processing.AddThis Java Code Style
is the code style that hydra tries to adhere to.Assuming you have Apache Maven installed
and configured:Should compile and build jars.  All hydra dependencies should be
available on maven central but hydra itself is not yet published.Berkeley DB Java Edition
is used for several core features.  The sleepycat license has strong
copyleft properties that do not match the rest of the project.  It is
set as a non-transitive dependency to avoid inadvertently pulling it
into downstream projects.  In the future hydra should have pluggable
storage with multiple implementations.The hydra-uber module builds an exec jar containing hydra and all
of it's dependencies.  To include BDB JE when building with mvn
package use -P bdbje.  The main class of the exec jar launches
the various components of a hydra cluster by name.JDK 8 is required.  Hydra has been developed on Linux (Centos 6) and
should work on any modern Linux distro.  Other unix-like systems
should work with minor changes but have not been tested.  Mac OSX
should work for building and running local-stack (see below).Hydra uses rabbitmq for low volume
command and control message exchange.  On a modern Linux systems
apt-get install rabbitmq-server and running with the default
settings is adequate in most cases.To run efficiently Hydra needs a mechanism to take copy on write
backups of the output of jobs.  The is currently accomplished by
adding the fl-cow library to
LD_PRELOAD.  Experimenting with other approaches such as ZFS or cp
--reflink are under consideration.Many components assume that there is a local user called hydra and
that all minion nodes can ssh as that user to each other.  This is
used most prominently for rsync based replicas. The user hydra
is not necessary when running a local-stack environment (see below).On OS X several utilities are necessary to run the local-stack environment:While hydra can be used for ad-hoc analysis of csv and other local
files, it's most commonly used in a distributed cluster.  In that case
the following components are involved:A typical configuration is to have a cluster head with Spawn &
QueryMaster backed by a homogeneous clusters of nodes running Minion,
QueryWorker, and Meshy.For local development all of the above components can run together in
a single stack run out of hydra-local.  There is a local-stack.sh
script to assist with this.  To run the local stack:The first time the script is run a hydra-local directory will be created.You can then navigate to http://localhost:5052/ and you should see

Twitter is a sell.Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. Source: bits.blogs.nytimes.comTwitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) announced Q2 earnings over a week ago and it was the talk of the Street. The company exceeded expectations on revenue growth and key metrics for monthly active user (""MAU""), timeline views and timeline views per MAU. Leading up the earnings announcement I predicted it would be D-Day for Twitter, and that the company would announce deteriorating operating metrics and flat revenue quarter-over-quarter. Below are actual results:Days after the company's Q2 earnings, additional concerns were raised. The Wall Street Journal reported that 14% of MAUs - up from 7% a year ago - never interacted with Twitter or saw an ad. Such ""Zombies"" connected through hundreds of thousands of third-party applications they have given permission to link to Twitter and were growing faster than the company's active users.Of the 271 million people counted in Twitter's latest tally, 14% or 37.9 million, never log in directly to Twitter's website or mobile app, the only places where Twitter serves ads. Instead, they connect through hundreds of thousands of third-party applications that the users have given permission to link to Twitter. These are the users who, for example, read tweets on digital-news app Flipboard, share photos on Twitter from Instagram, blast their location from Foursquare, or tweet stories from news sites. But they never open Twitter's mobile app or log in to Twitter.com, so they don't see Twitter's ads.The following chart illustrates the quarterly change in MAUs, broken down between active and inactive users.Impact of Twitter ZombiesZombies Can Keep Active Twitter Users Engaged Or Spur Page ViewsThough Zombies never log into Twitter's site or see ads, they do have a presence. According the Wall Street Journal, they read tweets on digital-news app Flipboard, share photos on Twitter via Instagram, tweet stories from news sites or blast their location from Foursquare. In some ways, Zombies help Twitter's active users stay engaged or spur their page views. Whenever LeBron James posts a picture to Twitter via Instagram, thousands react to the picture. Many would not have known about the picture had they not seen it on Twitter. In a similar vein, many people read my Seeking Alpha articles after I post them to Twitter. They do not necessarily go to Seeking Alpha looking for my articles; they simply search my Twitter page. In fact, some people read the articles and then tweet about them, keeping them more engaged.Presence Of Zombies Mutes Advertisers' ReachIn Q2 2014, Twitter had 271 million users of which 38 million were Zombies. That means only 233 million were active or actually saw an ad on Twitter. In Q1 2013 of the 218 million MAUs, 203 million were active and 15 million (7%) were Zombies. In effect, advertisers were marketing to 38 million fewer users than anticipated in Q1 2014. Going forward, that could reduce the amount of ads they show on Twitter or force them to negotiate lower advertising rates.Active Users Growing Less, More Engaged Than Once ThoughtThe following chart attempts to bifurcate Zombies and active users.Revenue Opportunity?The debate about Zombies has arisen through Twitter's attempts to illustrate the microblogger's impact beyond those who log in once a month. The attempt may have backfired, however, placing emphasis on the inefficiency of clients' ad spend on the service. The company is currently trying to wring more dollars from Zombies by placing ads on third-party sites that pull stories from Twitter. Such third-party revenue may be on the come, but the reduction in ad spend on Zombies may occur in real-time.ConclusionThe revelation that 14% of Twitter's MAUs never log into the service and never see an ad is damaging to Twitter's growth story. Zombies who post stories, articles or updates onto Twitter may keep the company's active users more engaged or spur more timeline views. However, given that the company's growth and advertising reach are less than once thought, I expect advertising rates, ad placement and advertising revenue to decline. At a $26 billion market capitalization based on Friday's close, Twitter trades at about 23x run-rate revenue of $1.12 billion. That said, Twitter is a sell.Disclosure: The author is short TWTR.

The life-long hunt for the ‚Äúmagic button,‚Äù which is believed to be the magical gateway to heighten a woman‚Äôs sexual pleasure, is nothing but quasi-mythical, one Italian scientist says. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature Reviews Urology, the ‚Äúintimate area‚Äù that leads a woman to climax, is not a spot but a ‚Äúsensitive area‚Äù known as the clitourethrovaginal (CUV) complex.The G-spot became known as the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù of female orgasms in the 1950s by Ernst Gr√§fenberg, a German gynecologist who claimed there was an area on the vaginal wall that, when stimulated, may lead to an orgasm. Despite women experiencing sensitivity more generally along the upper vaginal wall, rather than in a definable spot, the fascination of the G-spot has led to tons of literature published on how to find the small dime to half-a-dollar-sized area.Books like¬†Orgasm Answer Guide by Beverly Whipple, a sexpert for more than 30 years, and other sexperts, have perpetuated the myth of the G-spot as a way to understand the female orgasm to help men strike it rich by finding the ‚Äúpot of gold.‚Äù In a¬†survey conducted by Ann Summers, a British retail company specializing in sex toys and lingerie, 55 percent of men admitted to having never found their partner‚Äôs G-spot and 36 percent said they didn't even know what it is.   The elusive G-spot is a sex myth, says one Italian scientist, and not a magic button to turn a woman on. Photo courtesy of Shutterstock  The existence of a G-spot has been taken at face value, but the key to the female orgasm may not actually be a spot after all. ""Until now, studies have talked about a 'G-spot.' But it's not simply a spot as has previously been thought,‚Äù Emmanuele A. Jannini, lead author of the study and a professor of endocrinology and sexology at Tor Vergata university in Rome, told¬†The Local. ""Compared to the male erogenous zones, it is much more variable and complex, and also varies from woman to woman depending on the hormonal cycle.‚ÄùJannini and his colleagues, who sought to debunk the sex myth once and for all, have uncovered a larger intimate area for sexual stimulation in the female body. The Italian researchers believe there is a much more complex area that includes the complete reproductive system, including tissues, muscles, glands, and the uterus, that arouses women. The structure and interactions between the clitoris, urethra, and anterior vaginal wall have led this team to discover the CUV region. They consider it a ‚Äúmultifaceted morphofunctional‚Äù region that, when properly stimulated during penetration, could lead women to orgasm.""We know (now) there is a much more complex than a simple, phantasmagoric 'point,'"" Jannini said. He expressed to The Local¬†he hopes the study will ‚Äúhopefully forever‚Äù put an end to the talk about the location of the magical G-spot. The Italian researcher also emphasizes the vagina ‚Äúmust be respected‚Äù because it is not just a canal by which children are made.The Italian study isn‚Äôt the first to suggest the G-spot is nothing but a ""sex back."" A 2012 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found there was no evidence that suggests the G-spot exists. Dr. Amichai Kilchevsky, lead author of the study, and an urologist from the¬†Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut reviewed 100 studies conducted over the past 60 years that show no conclusive evidence to support the existence of the erogenous zone. ‚ÄúLots of women feel almost as though it is their fault they can't find it. The reality is that it is probably not something, historically or evolutionarily, that should even exist,‚Äù Kilchevsky said.Finding the G-spot has been seen as an impossible feat, since it has to do more with a physiological change, rather than being an anatomical structure. However, men and women alike can rejoice that the G-spot does not exist, taking some pressure off. Whether you choose to still call it the G-Spot, the CUV region, or your overall vagina, it‚Äôs important to know what you like and how your body responds to it.Source: Buisson O, Jannini EA, Rubio-Casillas A.

If we had to guess, it looks something like the filing that Google just made with the Federal Communications Commission. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Google this week told the FCC that reclassifying broadband providers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act would have a big side benefit for Google Fiber because it would give Google Fiber the same access to utility poles and other key infrastructure currently enjoyed by Comcast, AT&T and other big-name ISPs.RELATED:¬†Watch a man weep tears of joy when he finds out he‚Äôs getting Google FiberIn particular, Google tells the FCC that it‚Äôs had trouble gaining access to some utility poles, ducts, conduits and rights of way while it‚Äôs been rolling out Google Fiber. If it were regulated more like a utility, Google Fiber would be given access to these pieces of infrastructure, which would make it much cheaper and easier to build out its high-speed fiber network in new markets.‚ÄúPole access is fundamental and Google will never be able to make the case for Google Fiber without pole access,‚Äù¬†former FCC chairman Reed Hundt tells the Journal. ‚ÄúIf Title II gives Google pole access, then it might really rock the world with broadband access.‚ÄùSo to recap: Title II reclassification would not only slap ISPs with regulations they don‚Äôt want to deal with but it would also open the door for Google Fiber in more markets. If that‚Äôs not Comcast‚Äôs worst nightmare, I don‚Äôt know what is.Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use"

283,7732627,The Mossad is searching Facebook to find its latest recruits,http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nd0QWq0nAS4J:www.haaretz.com/blogs/outside-edge/.premium-1.590155+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ar,2014,"
        The Mossad is searching Facebook to find its latest recruits. Should we worry?
    Springtime in Israel: a season for wild poppies, flash floods, and the annual recruitment drive of the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations ‚Äì more commonly known as Mossad.But if these are the people they are looking for, the Mossad is in trouble.When I was at Cambridge, MI6 recruited their new intake via a quiet tap on the shoulder from an elderly tutor with elbow patches and a sherry-stained tie, trying ‚Äì but not always succeeding ‚Äì to avoid Communists. I‚Äôm told the process used to be fairly discreet in Israel as well ‚Äì a friendly summons from an elderly family ‚Äúuncle,‚Äù or (for recent immigrants) an anonymous invitation to an interview at a nameless office in an obscure building in central Tel Aviv.But times have changed. These days, you can get directions to Mossad HQ courtesy of Google Earth, or just look for the street sign named for the recently-deceased director.And Mossad now advertises across every platform from Facebook to LinkedIn, directing you to the positions vacant section of their website.There you‚Äôll find a useful (though necessarily redacted) history and the official Mossad motto. The original motto, taken from the Book of Proverbs, was an edgy, ""By subterfuge shall you make war."" That changed to a more mature quote from the same source: ‚ÄúWithout guidance do a people fall, and deliverance is in a multitude of counselors.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Mossad is looking for you,‚Äù whispers the come-hither pop-up at the side of my Facebook feed. ‚ÄúSomeone who wants to work in a unique and challenging place! Submit your CV for a range of roles. Sign in!‚ÄùThe most striking thing when you enter Mossad‚Äôs online recruitment section is the sheer number of new recruits they are looking for ‚Äì more than 70. Why is that? It‚Äôs a tiny organization of just a few hundred people. How come there are so many vacancies? Have they all been assassinated? Or struck down by a secret disease? Has everyone quit?I should reveal I‚Äôm a bit of an expert on the shadowy world of undercover espionage. Not only was I educated at the traditional recruiting-ground of British intelligence, I have seen all the James Bond movies (and read the books), plus the entire Jason Bourne oeuvre. I have read everything by Graham Greene, John le Carre, Len Deighton and Olen Steinhauer, most of Daniel Silva and the newest addition to the genre, Strip Mine by Dan Williams.And from my expert knowledge I can reveal that the Mossad is in deep trouble. Not only do their ranks appear to have been decimated, but the people they are now recruiting are, frankly, useless.First, there are dozens of ads for computer and electronics technicians with expertise in things such as CAD, Oracle, SQL, ESXI, MSSQL. What is this ‚Äì some kind of student start-up? Does the Mossad really believe it can penetrate the innermost circles of its enemies using a bunch of teenage computer geeks? Are they trying to steal secrets or create a consumer app?There‚Äôs not a single ad for a real spy ‚Äì the kind who can abseil down a skyscraper, scuba-dive in a dinner suit and defeat several heavily-armed goons with little more than their grandfather‚Äôs trusty watch and a starched wing-collar.Second, the ads require candidates to have ‚Äúcreative and flexible thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúwillingness to work at unsocial hours,‚Äù but what about the physical? We‚Äôve all seen the movies. We all know about ‚ÄúCindy‚Äù and the Mordechai Vanunu honey trap. Mossad men need to be hunks, the women need to be babes. We all know from the (alleged) Mabhouh assassination fiasco in Dubai just how bad the modern Israeli undercover operative looks in tennis whites. What‚Äôs the point in recruiting ugly, puny spies? They‚Äôll just get weeded out at the first parachute jump into the pool of thrashing sharks.Third, the only languages the Mossad are interested in appear to be Arabic and Persian. Yeah, right. Like fluency in those is going to secure you a place at the blackjack table in Monaco or help you go undercover among the bikini-clad babes on a super-yacht deck-party at Cannes.Fourth, all the techies sought by the Mossad are required to be conversant in .NET and other PC-based applications. Hey, Mr Pardo! That is so last century. Don‚Äôt you know that every self-respecting terror group is now fully mobile on Apple or Android cloud platforms? These guys wouldn‚Äôt know a GUI from a piece of exploding gum.Speaking of which, what about weapons, Pardo? Doesn‚Äôt anyone in the Mossad shoot anything anymore? Are you seriously telling me you don‚Äôt need a single crazy exploding pen inventor or a crackshot marksman/woman with a concealed micro-pistol-hidden-in-a-nailfile?It‚Äôs not all bad news. I‚Äôm assuming the fresh recruit with expertise in VOIP is the Mossad‚Äôs new phone-tapper, and the new RF guy is going to be installing hidden antennae in lipstick tubes. Glad also to see the requirement for Photoshop, though I prefer the traditional pen and ink document forgery methods myself.My theory: this list of want ads is a trick, put out by the Mossad to lull its enemies into thinking it‚Äôs become a bloated bunch of tech-drunk desk-jockeys.Somewhere out there, the budding sports car drivers, part-time light aircraft pilots, amateur submarine helmspeople and fearless downhill speed-skiers are going to get a tap on the shoulder.Matthew Kalman Haaretz Contributor Matthew KalmanFor a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

284,7768606,What is DevOps?,http://newrelic.com/devops/what-is-devops,2014,"These are the top 10 snapshot results. To see complete query results, hit 'Return'.There are many definitions of the word ‚ÄúDevOps.‚Äù Is it a movement? A new process or technology? A job title? Or just a way of thinking?‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù as a term was first coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, who became one of its chief proponents. Simply put, DevOps is a combination of software development and operations‚Äîand as its name suggests, it's a melding of these two disciplines in order to emphasize communication, collaboration, and cohesion between the traditionally separate developer and IT operations teams.Rather than seeing these as two distinct groups who are responsible for their specific tasks but don‚Äôt really work together, the DevOps methodology recognizes the interdependence of the two groups. By integrating these functions as one team or department, DevOps helps an organization deploy software more frequently, while maintaining service stability and gaining the speed necessary for more innovation.And, in the end, everyone is able to deliver the best results and overall experience possible to the customer.Just learning about DevOps? Read our step-by-step guide for what it is and why it matters for your digital business.Read ""Navigating DevOps""A few years ago, critical thinking on many converging methodologies‚Äîincluding Agile, Operations Management (Systems Thinking and Dynamics), Theory of Constraints, LEAN and IT Service management‚Äîall started bubbling up in conferences, talks, and Twitter (#devops) debates worldwide. These conversations eventually became the philosophy behind the DevOps movement.Agile software development paved the way, steering away from the waterfall method of software development toward a continuous development cycle. But this didn‚Äôt include the operations side, so while development could be continuous, deployment was still waterfall-oriented.In a DevOps environment, cross-functionality, shared responsibilities, and trust are all promoted. DevOps essentially extends the continuous development goals of the Agile movement to continuous integration and continuous delivery. In order to accommodate these continuous releases, DevOps encourages automation of the change, configuration, and deploy processes.The DevOps model found initial traction within native digital businesses. With modern applications running in public and private clouds, much of what was once considered infrastructure requiring manual processes now runs with highly automated processes for making changes and scaling applications.Sites with massive traffic numbers‚Äîlike Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Spotify‚Äîare all known to do deployments many times a day (or even minute). In order to deploy that often, you have to know you‚Äôre not going to break what‚Äôs already working or that a change can be undone easily. DevOps helps ensure frequent deploys with a low failure rate.Companies of all sizes are beginning to implement DevOps practices, and many shops, particularly lean startups, have been ‚Äúdoing DevOps‚Äù without calling it DevOps for quite some time. One example of a DevOps success story is media conglomerate Hearst Corporation, who built a next-generation digital platform and continue to innovate by employing DevOps principles.More deploys. Faster issue resolutions. Improved stability. Better collaboration and alignment. There are plenty of pros for doing DevOps.Discover the benefits

                                                	                                    Here for the first time, a German manager confesses his company‚Äôs total dependence on Google. What publishers are experiencing today is a sign of things to come: We will soon all belong to Google. An open letter to Eric Schmidt.
                                        Mathias D√∂pfner, CEO of Axel Springer SE, explains to Eric Schmidt, why the fear of Google is qualifiedDear Eric Schmidt,In your text ‚ÄúDie Chancen des Wachstums‚Äù (English Version: ‚ÄúA Chance for Growth‚Äù) in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, you reply to an article which this newspaper had published a few days earlier under the title ‚ÄúAngst vor Google‚Äù (‚ÄúFear of Google‚Äù). You repeatedly mention the Axel Springer publishing house. In the spirit of transparency I would like to reply with an open letter to highlight a couple of things from our point of view.(German version: &quot;Why do we fear Google&quot; - Mathias D√∂pfner open letter to Eric Schmidt)We have known each other for many years, and have, as you state, had lengthy and frequent discussions on the relationship between European publishers and Google. As you know, I am a great admirer of Google‚Äôs entrepreneurial success. In just a few short years, starting in 1998, this company has grown to employ almost 50,000 people worldwide, generated sixty billion dollars in revenue last year, and has a current market capitalization of more than 350 billion dollars. Google is not only the biggest search engine in the world, but along with Youtube (the second biggest search engine in the world) it also has the largest video platform, with Chrome the biggest browser, with Gmail the most widely used e-mail provider, and with Android the biggest operating system for mobile devices. Your article rightly points out what fabulous impetus Google has given to growth of the digital economy. In 2013, Google made a profit of fourteen billion dollars. I take my hat off to this outstanding entrepreneurial performance.In your text you refer to the marketing cooperation between Google and Axel Springer. We were also happy with it. But some of our readers have now interpreted this to mean that Axel Springer is evidently schizophrenic. On the one hand, Axel Springer is part of a European antitrust action against Google, and is in dispute with them regarding the issue of enforcement of German ancillary copyright prohibiting the stealing of content; on the other hand, Axel Springer not only benefits from the traffic it receives via Google but from Google‚Äôs algorithm for marketing the remaining space in its online advertising. You can call it schizophrenic ‚Äì or liberal. Or, to use one of our Federal Chancellor‚Äôs favorite phrases: there is no alternative.We know of no alternative which could offer even partially comparable technological prerequisites for the automated marketing of advertising. And we cannot afford to give up this source of revenue because we desperately need the money for technological investments in the future. Which is why other publishers are increasingly doing the same. We also know of no alternative search engine which could maintain or increase our online reach. A large proportion of high quality journalistic media receives its traffic primarily via Google. In other areas, especially of a non-journalistic nature, customers find their way to suppliers almost exclusively though Google. This means, in plain language, that we ‚Äì and many others ‚Äì are dependent on Google. At the moment Google has a 91.2 percent search-engine market share in Germany. In this case, the statement ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like Google, you can remove yourself from their listings and go elsewhere‚Äù is about as realistic as recommending to an opponent of nuclear power that he just stop using electricity. He simply cannot do this in real life ‚Äì unless he wants to join the Amish.Topics to this article: Amazon Apple Axel Springer Eric Schmidt European Union Facebook Germany Gmail All themes rates and financial data for the item: Amazon.com Apple Google Inc.

                        in Social Media
Dr. Liraz Margalit is the Customer Experience Psychologist at ClickTale.The past decade¬†has¬†been a time of incredible growth for social media, and Facebook in particular. The fact that the site has even topped Google as the most visited site in the US suggests that Facebook has become an integral part of how people connect and communicate with the world around them.Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage!Facebook allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video, send messages and ‚Äì above all ‚Äì keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues. However, Facebook‚Äôs ability to keep people connected is only part of the reason for its massive success.The truth is that Facebook allows us to connect not only with loved ones, but with our fundamental human needs. The same way that grocery stores are habituated into our routine to meet our need for physical sustenance, Facebook has become a daily destination for millions due to its ability to meet our needs for psychological fulfillment.¬†Self-esteem is considered to be one of the determinants that shape our psychological well-being. Self-esteem is in large part based on our self-schema, a model that organizes information about ourselves and reflects what we think about, care about, and spend our time and energy on.If, for example, ‚Äúbeing an athlete‚Äù is not an important aspect of your self-schema, then arriving last in the school‚Äôs running competition wouldn‚Äôt influence your self-esteem. However, if ‚Äúbeing smart‚Äù is an important aspect of your self-schema, then scoring low on an exam would negatively influence your self-esteem.Our Facebook profiles are micro-reflections of our self-schemata. In addition to our appearance, they include information about our hobbies, education level, number of friends, things we care about and so on.Thus, Facebook can unconsciously increase our self-esteem by providing us with the opportunity to reconstruct and control the way we present ourselves to the world. Furthermore, unlike public message boards, Facebook allows us to block any ‚Äútrolls‚Äù whose insults and mean-spirited discourse threaten our self-assurance.Impression management is the process through which people attempt to influence others‚Äô perception of their image by regulating and controlling information during social interaction. It is considered a key building block in interpersonal communications, with the goal of enhancing desired traits.Facebook, like most online interactions, allows the user to exercise a great deal of impression management.First of all, unlike face-to-face conversation, Facebook gives users as much time as they need to prepare a thoughtful or witty status update or wall post. Additionally, the influence of nonverbal behavior is entirely eliminated in the online arena.As a result, we have developed a set of explicit and implicit signals to help us form impressions of other Facebook users.The explicit signals consist of clear-cut measurements like number of friends, perceived quality of friends and education level.¬†The implicit signals are more subtle: frequent relationship status updates can imply instability; frequent profile photo changes and new posts can indicate an extroversion tendency, and frequent ‚Äòlike‚Äô-ing of others‚Äô content can indicate ingratiation attempts.Furthermore, the decision not to share information like relationship status and gender of interest reveals even more about the user than the information shared!A 2004 study by Samuel D. Gosling and Simine Vazire of the University of Texas found that Facebook profiles provide the observer with just as much information about the users‚Äô personalities as their bedroom or office.¬†Our initial interpretation of a user‚Äôs personality is accurate in most cases, and is revealed within the first few minutes of the interaction.Thus, Facebook can influence our self-esteem by giving us the opportunity to control the way we present ourselves through the process of impression management ‚Äì it can influence the way other people perceive us but most importantly, it can influence the way we perceive ourselves. We put a lot of time and effort into this self-customization because, on a subconscious level, we are reinventing a more positive version of ourselves. This is reflected in the composition of our carefully selected profile elements.We present our most attractive photos; list favorite movies, music and books that we feel will impress others; and send friend requests to not only our friends and family, but to the people we respect and want to be associated with. Self-perception theory (SPT) asserts that people develop their attitudes by observing their own behavior and then making conclusions about the attitudes that must have been responsible for the behavior. Thus, the individual interprets his own overt behaviors rationally, in the same way he attempts to explain others‚Äô behaviors.This helps to explain how one‚Äôs own Facebook profile can promote positive self-perception and contribute to our psychological well-being.¬†Facebook provides extroverts with an immediate vent for their needs and obsessions. Extroverts have been shown to update their profile photos, status, and information they reveal about themselves much more frequently than other users. Thus, Facebook allows them to act out their hidden desires without the fear of being perceived as arrogant or narcissistic.Imagine a person asking others to look at his photos at a social gathering; he would immediately be perceived as breaking social codes. On Facebook, however, it is considered a legitimate activity.Facebook has become¬†a habit ‚Äì a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur unconsciously. The formation of every habit we adopt is triggered by a conscious or unconscious reward, which helps our brain decide if a particular action is worth remembering for the future.We may originally register on Facebook in order to be connected to our friends but, without realizing it, the site becomes an addictive habit because we discover that it provides us with subconscious psychological rewards. Over time, this loop becomes more and more automatic as it is imprinted in our neural pathways. The result? 1.23 billion monthly active users.Read next: The emotional involvement behind social media interactionsTop image credit:¬†MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/GettyImages

288,7586881,"Sorry, Google. Enough is enough.",http://karakehayov.com/?,2014,"We don‚Äôt believe in ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù anymore(click here for a similar, less technical version you would understand even if you don‚Äôt know what SEO is)This is a hard-to-believe story of (100% proven) large scale power abuse by Google. But maybe the damage was not in vain, because in our desperation an idea was born, an idea that everyone at Google right up to Larry Page and Sergey Brin will find disturbing.Google went too far and the SEO community has to take action. Even if Matt Cutts tells you they need SEO-s, we are taking potential Adwords revenue from Google and their natural economic goal is to destroy us. In fact they are doing a good ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù job and we now officially have the ‚ÄúLive together or Die alone‚Äù choice.But I refuse to believe Google will have their evil corporate wishes fulfilled. I have never seen a community as strong and smart as SEO-s and webmasters in my life. We have all the resources to fight back, we just need to realize the time has come and do it. Today I will tell you my story and how I think we can decrease and balance Google‚Äôs power for good. Despite the economic war Google is waging against SEO and small business, we can stand our ground. Despite their overwhelming monopoly over web search and advertising, there is a way out and it‚Äôs not a hard one to follow. We have no choice, but to fight back ‚Äì not only for ourselves, but to help countless virtually helpless small business owners, that are looking at their website visits, shattered by penalties, wondering if it‚Äôs worth starting over. They were our first clients and helped us become the SEO experts we are. We owe it to them.And you Google, you have lost the key factor to success. You lost everyone‚Äôs trust. 10 years from now history will look back at Matt Cutts and conclude lack of two-way communication and transparency were the main reasons for your downfall.Several days ago our small SEO freelancer team received a final blow from Google. After years of slowly increasing bullying, they decided to destroy our websites and manually deindexed most of what we have for being ‚Äúpure spam‚Äù. We lost everything.Our websites are NOT a network, not interlinked, nor integrated in any service, use a common basic WordPress installation leaving no fingerprints and are scattered among shared hosting services with thousands of other websites. They are not listed anywhere nor have the same links. Google probably tracked them by whois data, Analytics and/or Webmaster tools data, though we have diversified that too. They went our of their way to manually fight and destroy a small freelancer team in a country where the medium net salary is about $400. This is so ‚Äúnice‚Äù from a corporation with $50 billion of yearly revenues. Three of the people in our team are living in rural areas of Bulgaria, where they are almost no jobs available and they all have to support families.My team has been working in SEO for the last 5 years. We were hit by the Penguin updates and have since changed our SEO strategies to rely on supporting websites on strong dropped domains (it works!). We spent 2 years working hard on dropped domains and currently have amazing lists of (mostly) CCTLD domain names with history, backlinks and authority ripe for the picking. Needless to say Google doesn‚Äôt like this.Profit is not everything for us. We are trying to do cool stuff, in the rare times we can afford it we donate to charity, we have helped NGOs improve their websites and we try to give society a fair share of our knowledge and skills. We recently caught our first high traffic dropped domain and we redirected it to this wonderful video http://vimeo.com/36789712, instead of profiting from it.We also deeply value the Internet. We have our own beautiful black hat SEO script for content generation, that works in all languages for all keywords and requires no time/money investment (other than domain name) to generate content and ultimately long tail traffic. It has been through successful testing and we are NOT using it because we don‚Äôt want to pollute the Internet with meaningless content for profit only. We are not the bad guys.But the Google manual actions team has done everything in their power do destroy us. For we have committed the worst crime ‚Äì we‚Ä¶ sell backlinks. Of course this does not break a single law of the real world, nor does it do any harm whatsoever, but Google, who sell A LOT of ads themselves, some very annoying (like Youtube pre-rolls), have decided, that whoever sells these non-obstructive SEO targeted ads has to be manually penalized. But in fact Google in a way relies on paid links, because they separate the guy with budget (the big one, The Brand) from the guy without budget (potential scammer, reseller, affiliate -> maybe lower quality website). And the guys with budget often offer better services. So paid links bring Google high competition serps more good than harm. But they channel more budgets away from Adwords and into SEO, so Google in very hypocritical fashion has been condemning them. Ever wondered why:- Recently (in the last year or so) when a link seller is being penalized, the links buyers, even ones who bought en masse, had no harm at all (if they didn‚Äôt do something silly like similar anchor texts)? I thought the link buyers manipulate the serps, because they are the ones who actually RANK somewhere? The answer is ‚Äì Google actually likes paid links for stabilizing serps, that‚Äôs why.- How come Google never actually destroyed all the link selling networks?? Some got hit here and there so Matt Cutts has something to tweet about, but these are just PR stunts to scare people away. In fact the link buyers and link sellers in a network can be identified with Google‚Äôs resources for a day using a simple algorithm, that any kid, who studied graphs in school, can think about. And I mean a day for all links networks in the world together. They just don‚Äôt want to destroy them! This is not an isolated example ‚Äì Yandex and Sape.ru have been in a similar symbiotic relationship in Russia for ages.So Google tells you: Don‚Äôt buy backlinks (use the money for Adwords), but if you already bought them in the right way, you will rank, thanks for stabilizing serps.Actually some years ago Google was treating link sellers in a very fair way by giving them Pagerank penalties if they went too far. They remained in the index and could rank. This has come to an end and now websites are often deindexed for selling backlinks, as if quality of content has something to do with link trade, that is profit-driven, just like having Adsense on 99% of your website above the fold (much more annoying, also profit-driven, but websites don‚Äôt get deindexed for it ‚Äì worst case scenario is Panda). Still tons of people are selling backlinks with no consequences like the networks I mentioned.The Google manual actions team has investigated manually (must have been hard, involved digging personal data from whois records) all of our websites (about 1000), has deindexed almost all of them, including websites with no links, (that have never ever had links), that in no way are against Google webmaster guidelines. Even a domain, 301 redirected to a relevant resource has received a manual penalty (on a‚Ä¶ non-existing website? Should be a joke, but it‚Äôs real!)They also refuse to remove the penalties on websites, that have no sold backlinks and have some unique meaningful content 100% covering Google webmaster guidelines. Obviously if you once made the huge sin of selling backlinks (that are mostly good for Google Serps, remember), in such way possibly taking away Adwords money, you are deindexed forever. Or you just have your reconsideration request denied because you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ well, you  I‚Äôm sure the European Commission and other authorities will be thrilled with the idea, that according to Google the websites of some people do not deserve a place in the index, because Google doesn‚Äôt like the people, although the websites are fine. How fantastic is that for a policy   Focus on website quality, Google says. Really!?!?Poverty? Google doesn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶Ecology? Google doesn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶Really serious issues about girls and women? Not important enough for Google  Come on Google, not even actual missing children are good enough for you?¬†Google also filters hand-picked criticism links, smells like¬†outright censorship  But of course Google has to be right about something? They are right about one thing, the one and only fair decision of their editors. Ever. Here it is:¬†Ha! Google editors think a complete list of videos by Matt Cutts is spam   Couldn‚Äôt agree more, they are like the SEO Fox News Channel ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier to find water in the desert, than genuine information in them.¬†¬†So Google either doesn‚Äôt give a shit about Nature, Women, Girls, Relationships, Education, Pollution and Poverty‚Ä¶ or this is much too personal against my team. More personal than the European law does allow in my opinion, considering Google is a complete monopoly in search.In fact we have more than a hundred very good articles (very factual, Wikipedia style), that were good enough for removing a website penalty sometimes, and not good enough at other times. This proves Google just hates us and has no problem in disregarding its own guidelines to hurt our websites.Our vast experience with penalties shows Google editors hardly follow any guidelines at all. Once (for test purposes) we tricked them into believing we are a government agency in the reconsideration request and they removed the penalty of a website with ZERO content.But we wanted to have a 100% proof this is personal so we moved the content of a 3-article blog about preserving nature, that Google considered violating guidelines, to a Blogspot blog. So the same website, actually worse ‚Äì with content stolen from the actual source. It was indexed, so we wanted to see what Google editors think of it, so we‚Ä¶ reported it (first time ever we report anything, had to search where the damn form is) They still think it‚Äôs OK. They don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs ours  We tried to reach them and solve it like civilized people. I tried contacting a Google employee on Google+ and when there was no result the top Bulgarian SEO expert notified the Google Bulgaria team of the situation, but again there was no contact made. No problem can be solved when you ignore it and avoid all communication. This is a dictatorship, that has no place in the 21st century.We have no question that this is a personal war against our team with the goal of draining us financially and emotionally. Do you know the feeling of hundreds of your websites disappearing from the index in a flashlight? Probably not and you are lucky. I have experienced this 7 times. And we have more than 8000 reconsideration requests denied for no obvious reason. Google wants us to give up.Unfortunately Google, you just made a very big mistake. You just gave a team of smart, creative and stubborn people the motivation of their lives. We are the now the cornered tiger, that will fight to the very end or until the enemy runs away for good.We no longer have a job, because almost every website we own is deindexed. So Google, we decided that because you hit our profits, we will hit yours, while making the world a better place.See, Google, you broke a golden business principle, that is taught in business class for dummies ‚Äì diversify your income. Almost all of your profits come from Adwords, so it was pretty easy to think of a way to hit you where it hurts. Let me introduce you to Ad filtering¬†- a great concept in a world where annoying ads are crawling all over the place while Youtube wants to make us see unwanted pre-roll ads. And if you say they are targeted ‚Äì not only they are not, buy how could you let the worst musical performers in Bulgaria buy so much pre-rolls‚Ä¶ they make my years hurt   Ah, yes, I forgot ‚Äì MONEY. Only Ad filtering removes even pre-rolls so we can make your MONEY become LESS MONEY, while of course we are doing the world a favor, by saving people: website loading time, energy, CPU load, bandwidth, all while improving user experience. My personal favorites are¬†uBlock¬†for Chrome, Safari and Firefox, they don‚Äôt download the ads at all ‚Äì this also greatly improves privacy by not downloading some questionable cookies. Just compare:‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîI bet guys trading Google stocks would love to see a team of dedicated top-notch SEO and online advertising professionals working day and night to decrease Google profits by telling the whole world how great Ad filtering browser plugins are. Nothing spells a better future for a company than this message, right? By the way did I mention, that we will inspire a lot of other webmasters and small business owners Google crushed manually or with Penguin to join the party and promote Ad filtering too   What if it becomes viral and starts an avalanche? For every percent of global market share growth for Ad filtering browser plugins, you Google will lose in the long run more than $ 2 billion (yes, billion with a ‚Äúb‚Äù).I think just with the guys in my team, we can achieve this Ad filtering 1% growth in an year, but with the help of all SEO-s around the world‚Ä¶ this is where even Matt Cutts will get the shivers, not to mention Google shareholders.We came up with a name for the process, we call it ‚Äúcrowd defunding‚Äù ‚Äì the media will love it, also makes a great hashtag #CrowdDefunding ‚Äì useful whenever a lot of people decide to take corporate money back  Google, you are now at the mercy of webmasters, and if they treat you like you have treated them in the last 2 years‚Ä¶ God help you.And to make you even happier Google, I will track our progress right here on karakehayov.com and every day I will update you with how much we have managed to rid you of unnecessary future profits, that will go instead to free clicks in organic search, thus supporting struggling local businesses and the SEO community you are trying to destroy. Turning us SEO-s on one another by introducing reports and disavow tool and making negative SEO an option HAS NOT worked. Today we stand united and the message you‚Äôre reading is a call for the community to fight back. I hope you all share it until more Webmasters/SEO-s have seen it than any Matt Cutts video!If you ever got hit by Google ‚Äì join the party, share the message and/or hit them where it hurts ‚Äì promote Ad filtering with plugins, that filter Adwords in Search BY DEFAULT (Sorry, Google. That‚Äôs for being evil) like¬†uBlock¬†for Chrome, Safari and Firefox.¬†If you haven‚Äôt got hit yet you still better join because:We share the same world, so lets do what‚Äôs best for us people, the economy and not the huge and increasingly greedy corporation that tested 41 different shades of blue to find out what makes you click on their paid ads the most.Sadly for you Google, actually a world with less Adwords will be a little better for end users, much better for SEO-s, much better for small businesses and much better for the economy in general. No one will care for your loss, even if it is billions of $.Here are some thoughts on promoting Ad filtering for Google to consider:If you read this far you are my personal hero and I‚Äôm grateful to the bottom of my Google-broken heart. If you share this, we have a chance to make this uneven fight a more just one. Totally up to you though  If we reach the critical mass, maybe we can convince Google to open up a dialogue and eventually improve the system of penalties and reconsideration, instead of leaving us to bang our heads with automated answers or none whatsoever. And most of all we need a system, where they will have to act in a responsible way even for a problem on the small website of a crumbling small business, that has no choice but to be at Google‚Äôs mercy about making ends meet.Although we are now broke, an achievement this big will mean the world to us. It‚Äôs up to you   Also I would love it if you show support (or criticism of course) in the comments.Kalin Karakehayov, head of a small Bulgarian SEO team of freelancers.You can find me at:

I have done SEO for my own web site.While SEO activites,I realized that,SEO has not got logiacl steps.Everything has been changing .For example,page rank ;Copy web sites can take h√ºgher page rank frm an originally website.
Regards,
Guzelim GuzelAgree with you, Kalin! I see a lot of WTF results too when doing keyword research in some of my niche. No wonder more and more people are still dong black hat techniques!Yeah AdBlock for ad free youtube videos  For me, the witch-hunt on guest blogging was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. It has become ‚Äútoo spammy‚Äù whatever that means. Guest blogging helped a lot of small business owners & bloggers connect with customers & a wider audience. In the real world, guest speakers are invited for events but since this would hurt Adwords revenue in the long run ‚Äì ‚Äúit became too spammy‚Äù.You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ They are destroying SEO. People who don‚Äôt see this have listened to Matt Cutts more than it‚Äôs good for their SEO sanity   They have their heads in the sand‚Ä¶Installed ad filtering, and shared it on Facebook. Not to harm anyone but it will definitely boost the ‚Äòuser experience‚Äô.That‚Äôs not fair and i‚Äôll fight with you . It‚Äôs like  Google AdSense Employee Claims AdSense Steals From Publishers http://www.shoemoney.com/2014/04/29/alg-google-adsense-employee-blows-whistle that was revealed yesterday. Fight just begin.Everyone who uses Adsense knows about their unfair policy already. I‚Äôm glad we have got a solid confirmation.Suggestion to have SEO and webmaster support: launch an Adblock-like that will block only Google.tld and Youtube ads.Cause if you reach success in promoting Adblock, anti Adblock scripts will be more and more installed in websites (because you‚Äôll kill their revenues), and so people may delete Adblock to get access back to their favorite URLs, and so you‚Äôll loose your target.I don‚Äôt think Google search or Youtube will ever deny service for users with Adblock. This will cause an outrage. Making a whole new plugin is complicated, but I can make a custom filter for the existing plugins, that‚Äôs easy.I wasn‚Äôt talking about Google websites here, but about the (many) small ones that live with Adsense (and there are big ones too).If we raise the market share of Adblock by 1% (from 3% to 4%), each publisher would barely notice, but Google will lose 2 billion dollars in 4 years. That is our goal. We certainly don‚Äôt want to hurt the online community and small publishers.By the way, Adblock Plus doesn‚Äôt block SERP Google ads by default (people have to uncheck ‚Äúallow non intrusive advertising‚Äù), that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs your best card to play.This is why I don‚Äôt recommend Adblock Plus at all (see above). Use Adblock Edge for Firefox instead  Really interesting story :D.I was stunned supports googleVery interesting war  Installed ad filtering, and shared it on Facebook. Not to harm anyone but it will definitely boost the ‚Äòuser experience‚Äô.Great initiative I have been hit with a MANUAL penalty also. My money website was a White Label site, which is a copy of a mother website selling products to which you can change the SEO and drive your traffic to it so you can monetize. Google told me its a low quality/affiliate website and slapped me by deindexing its home page. Its basically like shutting down the small grocery store because essentially is selling the same products like the big supermarkets. Following this logic, and I noticed in the last few years that this is how google will function in the future, unless you invest money and create a big brand you are doomed. There is no small business that has a chance to compete with the big guns, there is no diversity and imagination left in google‚Äôs mind, it‚Äôs just WALLMART or no-one(to follow your example). This is above censorship, it got even deeper, google actually tells you what to buy/consume, not only he forbids you to make a choice, he force feeds you with whoever and whatever it wants. We have a huge problem demonstrating this to normal users because them, if they had nothing to do with websites and google serps have no idea and can‚Äôt understand the problem, so we need to simplify the matter and expose it in a clearer and more straight forward way so everyone will understand that this issue is affecting them too.Few recommendations: Increase the text font in the comment box ‚Äì I can bearly see it and i am under 30 years old lol
Make Adblock Edge in english, or the description page on firefox add ons in english, i did not try it, i barely installed it.
Make some sort of catchy phrase or tool to make people integrate a banner or something cute in their website as a protest.Lets get our internet back.Another way to fight Google is to start using another search engine. A good choice would be duckduckgo in which you search anonymously and nobody tracks you.Imho, Google just gone full retard‚Ä¶ nowadays the ads are simply useless and most of them are virus or plain bad propaganda done the bad way trying to force bad stuff on people using questionable techniques.Just look at android devices, like 99% of ‚Äòapps‚Äô on google play have ads, most ads are simply a lie, like ‚Äòyou have a virus‚Äô or ‚Äòyour android is slow‚Äô and if you click them you end up in a website filled with malwares that pops a sh!tload of messages on your screen practically forcing you to install their sh!t.Nowadays like >99% of the ads are malicious, the result is that there‚Äôs no human being not wanting to somehow get rid of them, and they‚Äôre all slowly learning that they‚Äôre simply bullshit‚Ä¶ you see an ad about a cool ‚Äòphotoshopey‚Äô application? that‚Äôs virus; see an ad about a cool wow-like game? -virus; see and ad saying you have virus? -virus; see and add saying your device is slow? -virus; basically, every ad nowadays is either malicious or simply links to viruses. Try clicking on one of those ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù buttons that‚Äôs not the ‚Äòright‚Äô one, it‚Äôs kinda guaranteed your computer will end up contracting a virus that will need an exorcist to get rid of.The guys at Google are so stupid that they‚Äôre making sure their ads won‚Äôt worth anything in the future because everybody will be aware that they‚Äôre simply false advertising and in most cases you get screwed by clicking on them. That‚Äôs a fact of life. Give a monkey a poisoned banana, it‚Äôll eat it right away and feel sick, give it another one, if it‚Äôs really dumb (like most of internet users nowadays) it‚Äôll eat it again, but try a next one‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll spit on your face and get bananas from someone else.Though I sympathize deeply with the personal situations of employees and seeming unfairness inherent with Google‚Äôs power, the fault here is trying to build a sustainable business around a certain set of tactics completely dependent on the unregulated actions of another business (Google).The entire black hat industry essentially has the same value proposition: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre smarter than Google, at the moment.‚Äù  And while this can lead to spectacular short term value for black hats and their clients, to maintain the value to your clients requires you to stay smarter than one of the world‚Äôs largest companies in the long run.  Using this as a fundamental business model is questionable at best, and most black hats are willing to accept the risk involved, but it seems that you are not.  I am sorry for your current predicament, but in the future do not build a business in such a volatile industry that cannot predictably deliver long term value without relying on favorable conditions from a company outside of your control.The best thing would be to block ads directly in the SERP  Too much butthurt, bro. I was penalized by Google a lot of times in the past (9 years in SEO industry), but always managed to survive. You just overreacted.Hi, i totally agree with you , i experienced the same with google. they are to powerfull and their share of the market is too big.To really hurt google is too lobby at the european union and their commision that deals with competition. write to them and to all the parlement members about how google works and how big their marketshare is and questions will be asked in parlement and hopefully action taken. (write also seperate to the european goverment countrys parlementmembers and ask for investigation and action so there will be some kind of  response!),and who knows a avelanche always start with a small peace of snow falling first.
 i dont know who is the minister at the moment but it use to be Neelie Kroes from holland, she gave a lot of big fines to big companys and stopped a lot of big companys fusions beacause because they would get to big and powerfull  and there would be not enough competion anymore, the same as google at the moment.THey can break the power of google and force them to devide the market in a more competetive way.
for instance in the UK google has a 85% marketshare in Holland it‚Äôs even 95% Marketshare and thats too big of a share for any company. especially if that company decides what we can read, what we look for, where too buy and from who too buy,nearly all  the information we get is from google and google decides what we can see or not.
Thats totally out of order they have too much influence. And that power has to be broken and the European union and their commision can do that.second they only pay about 1-2% tax , while they closing down websites from ordinairy people who try too make a litlle bit of income. The european union and the American senate and congress want to stop this as well give them enough motivation information and your own experience than they got something to work with.,thats where you can get them and really hurt them big time. They have the power to take down google to a normal size business and divide their market share over several other companys.Inform people and politici with this information and the more people and politici start to see  how unfair google works and how greedy they are then they get the opinion against them and politici will speak out against this. and hopefully take action against them. The more people and politici see how they making biilions and pay no tax over it ,while they are destroying litlle businesses of normal people who do pay taxes ,they get the peoples opinion and symphatie against them. and then maby people stop using google and demand for actions against them.Since I am another one of many people whose websites have been completely removed from Google‚Äôs SERP for no reason, I suggest that we either organize an online petition and introduce it to the European Parliament or directly contact Mrs. Margrethe Vestager (http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager_en). She is famous for initiating an antitrust investigation about Google and their dominant position on the European market, thus forcing customers to use only their online services when buying Android devices.To get back on the track, I believe this kind of penalties that Google apply on websites are a complete censorship. They say that you need to adhere to the Google Webmasters Guidelines but when they put a penalty on a website they do not tell you what‚Äôs the actual problem with this website. Such kind of judgement isn‚Äôt transparent enough in its core. Having in mind this shady methods of evaluation, I believe Google has established non-equal standards for all players on the digital market in terms of content and style of expression. So.. you have Google who says what content should be published and how it should be published. Either do what Google says, or you won‚Äôt be in the SERP. Well, this violates all human rights in terms of freedom of speech and by definition is a complete censorship. What do you think of this idea?Google does not know what you‚Äôre doing anymore. Continuous sequence changes. I‚Äôm tired of SEO. I look forward to your recommendations.Your email address will not be published.

289,9932076,Hacking team press statement,http://thehackernews.com/2015/07/hacking-team-press-statement.html,2015,"








 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 






Hacking Team, the Italy-based spyware company that sells spying software to law enforcement agencies worldwide, says the company has always operated with the law and regulation in an ethical manner.



However, there was only one Violation of Law in this entire event, and that is ‚Äì ""the massive cyber attack on the Hacking Team."" company stated.



The recent hack on Hacking Team exposed nearly 500GB of massive internal documents including internal emails, hacking tools, zero-day exploits, surveillance tools, source code for Spyware and a spreadsheet listing every government client with date of purchase and amount paid.



Hacking Team Hack and Media Reports:



The attack on Hacking Team was really huge in every sense. The team finally shows its disappointment with media on its hacking incident saying, the company that helps government fight crimes is being treated as the culprits, and the criminals who attacked the company are not.


""Had a media company been attacked as Hacking Team has been, the press would be outraged,"" Hacking Team wrote in its press release Wednesday.


But, every media including us have mentioned that Hacking Team got hacked, which by default indicates that they were the victim to cyber crime.



So far, neither they nor anyone in media knows who has hacked and leaked 500GB of internal data belonging to Hacking Team.



So, what do they expect from Media to talk about?

The Unknown Hacker, about whom no one knows,
or the 500 GB of leaked Hacking Team‚Äôs Secrets


Hacking Team Spyware: Fighting for Crime or aiding Surveillance?



Apart from this, the Hacking Team claimed that the strong spyware and hacking tools developed by the company are actually required by the law enforcement agencies to fight crime and terrorism.



We all know that what NSA and other government agencies are doing (espionage/surveillance) with such capabilities, instead of putting every effort to fight crime and terrorism.



Recently, a 46-year-old member of South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) apparently committed suicide after it was revealed that the Asian country bought spying tools from the Hacking Team.



A Suicide note left by the agent at the scene referenced the Hacking Team controversy, and claimed his intelligence team did not use Hacking Team tools to spy on South Korean citizens' mobile phone or any other online communications. 



This incident could be part of the same conspiracy, which is yet to be investigated.




Some Facts Highlighted by Hacking Team



Highlighting the facts about its recent hack attack, the company says the attackers stole and exposed the personal information of its employees and some of its clients.



However, the attackers were unable to access the data collected by company's clients using purchased spying software, as such information is only stored on the customer's systems and can‚Äôt be accessed by the company itself.



The attackers also exposed some of its source code on the Internet, but according to Hacking Team, the essential elements of its source code were not compromised in the attack.



The company agreed of selling its equipments to countries, including Ethiopia, Sudan, Russia and South Korea among others, but always sold ""strictly under the law and regulation.""



""There have been reports that our software contained some sort of ""backdoor"" that permitted Hacking Team insight into the operations of our clients or the ability to disable their software,"" The company says. 



""This is not true.""



""No such backdoors were ever present, and clients have been permitted to examine the source code to reassure themselves of this fact.""



The company also denied its involvement in any program that make use of airborne drones to attack computers and smartphone devices through Wi-Fi networks as it has been reported earlier this week.

291,8495251,Node.js LoopBack Example Applications and Tutorials,http://bit.ly/1tbULxP,2014,"It‚Äôs always easier to learn something from an example. At StrongLoop, we know this well, so we created a multitude of example apps to go along with LoopBack. However, the core LoopBack engineers have been too busy adding new features, fixing bugs, and moving the framework forward and to devote time to updating example apps. To this end, new StrongLoop engineer Simon Ho has been working to update the LoopBack example modules, and writing comprehensive READMEs that walk you through the steps to recreate each app.He‚Äôll be continuing his work in the coming weeks, but here‚Äôs a list of recently-updated examples:These are added to the existing LoopBack 2.0 examples:More are coming soon, including:Many folks on the LoopBack Google Group have expressed interest in learning more about the LoopBack AngularJS SDK. One of the new tutorials, the AngularJS Starter Example is devoted to just this, so we‚Äôve included it below‚Ä¶ Enjoy!This example demonstrates how to use LoopBack with AngularJS. It‚Äôs a simple ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù list application that uses LoopBack on the back end and AngularJS on the front end.Before starting, makes sure you‚Äôve followed Getting Started with LoopBack to install Node and LoopBack.Install Bower to manage front-end dependencies:
$ npm install -g bowerIn addition, you will need a basic understanding of:First, run the application so you can understand what it does:$ git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-angular
$ cd loopback-example-angular
$ npm install
$ slc runYou‚Äôll see a screen such as that shown above. ¬†Enter a couple of ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù items, and click Add or press Return to add the item to the list. ¬†Then delete an item by the clicking the ‚Äúx‚Äù to its right.That‚Äôs basically it ‚Äìa very simple app. ¬†Note that if you stop the app (with Ctrl-C) and restart it, all your ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù items will be preserved.Follow the steps below to create the application from scratch.1. Create the application
Run slc loopback, and name the app my-lb-angular-starter.¬†2. Configure the data source
Edit server/datasources.json to look like:
This change will persist model instances to a JSON file. For more information, see the memory connector documentation.¬†3. Create the Todo modelEnter this command:
$ slc loopback:model
Respond to slc‚Äôs prompts as follows:¬†4. Add some model data
Start the server:$ slc runThen load localhost:3000/explorer in your browser.¬†Under Parameters, click in the Model Schema field to automatically copy the JSON data template to the data field. Then edit the Todo item in the data field to look as follows:
Leave the¬†id¬†property alone; LoopBack will automatically increment it each time you add a new model instance.¬†5. Verify the model instance has been inserted
Open db.json; it will be in the application root directory. You will see this:
Notice the ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù property contains the model you just created.¬†6. Configure the vendor directory
Create a .bowerrc file in the application root directory with the following contents:
Bower installs packages in bower_components by default, but this setting changes it to client/vendor instead to make it easier to import files into index.html.¬†7. Install front-end dependencies
In the application root directory, enter:
¬†8. Create index.html
Create index.html In the /client directory and add the following contents from the basic Bootstrap getting started template:
¬†9. Create stylesheet
Create a css directory inside the client directory. Inside the newly created directory, create a file named style.css with the following contents:
¬†10. Add Bower dependencies
Modify index.html to look like the following. ¬†Note: For your production app, use the minified versions of Bower dependencies.
¬†11. Configure index.html to be the application entry point
Remove server/boot/root.js and modify server/server.js to look like this:
¬†12. Create app.js and configure application routes
In the client directory, create another directory named js. Inside the js directory, create a file named app.js with the following contents:
For more information on application routing, see AngularUI Router documentation.NOTE: If you‚Äôre using jshint, you can add ‚Äúpredef‚Äù: [‚Äòangular‚Äô] to .jshintrc to prevent Angular specific warnings.13. Add apps.js as a dependency in index.html:
¬†14. Create todo.html
In client/js, create a directory named todo. Inside the todo directory, create another directory named templates. In this directory, create a file named todo.html with the following contents:
¬†15. Create controllers.js
In client/js/todo, create controllers.js with the following contents:
¬†16. Add controllers.js as a dependency in index.html:
¬†17. Generate LoopBack Angular services file, lb-services.js
Create a new directory named common in client/js. Change to the common directory and run this command:
This generates a file named lb-services.js which is an Angular service used to interface with your back-end application. For more information, see the LoopBack AngularJS SDK.18. Declare lb services as a dependency.
Edit client/js/app.js and add the following:
Also add lb-services.js as a dependency in index.html:
¬†19. Run the application
From the project root, enter slc run and browse to localhost:3000 to view the application.For more information, see the LoopBack Angular SDK documentation.¬†Contact us

          Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.
        Would you like to use a linux-like console on a Windows host without a lot of fuzz? Try out babun!Have a look at a 2 minutes long screencast by @tombujok: http://vimeo.com/95045348Just download the dist file from http://babun.github.io, unzip it and run the install.bat script. After a few minutes babun starts automatically.
The application will be installed to the %USER_HOME%\.babun directory. Use the '/target' option to install babun to a custom directory.Babun features the following:Pre-configured Cygwin with a lot of addonsSilent command-line installer, no admin rights requiredpact - advanced package manager (like apt-get or yum)xTerm-256 compatible consoleHTTP(s) proxying supportPlugin-oriented architecturePre-configured git and shellIntegrated oh-my-zshAuto update feature""Open Babun Here"" context menu entryHave a look at a sample screenshot!Do you like it? Follow babun on Twitter @babunshell or @tombujok.The core of Babun consists of a pre-configured Cygwin. Cygwin is a great tool, but there‚Äôs a lot of quirks and tricks that makes you lose a lot of time to make it actually 'usable'. Not only does babun solve most of these problems, but also contains a lot of vital packages, so that you can be productive from the very first minute.Babun provides a package manager called pact. It is similar to 'apt-get' or 'yum'. Pact enables installing/searching/upgrading and deinstalling cygwin packages with no hassle at all. Just invoke pact --help to check how to use it.Babun‚Äôs shell is tweaked in order to provide the best possible user-experience. There are two shell types that are pre-configured and available right away - bash and zsh (zsh is the default one). Babun‚Äôs shell features:syntax highlightingUNIX toolssoftware development toolsgit-aware promptcustom scripts and aliasesand much more!Mintty is the console used in babun. It features an xterm-256 mode, nice fonts and simply looks great!Babun supports HTTP proxying out of the box. Just add the address and the credentials of your HTTP proxy server to the .babunrc file located in your home folder and execute source .babunrc to enable HTTP proxying. SOCKS proxies are not supported for now.Babun provides many packages, convenience tools and scripts that make your life much easier. The long list of features includes:programming languages (Python, Perl, etc.)git (with a wide variety of aliases and tweaks)UNIX tools (grep, wget, curl, etc.)vcs (svn, git)oh-my-zshcustom scripts (pbcopy, pbpaste, babun, etc.)Babun has a very small microkernel (cygwin, a couple of bash scripts and a bit of a convention) and a plugin architecture on the top of it. It means that almost everything is a plugin in the babun‚Äôs world! Not only does it structure babun in a clean way, but also enables others to contribute small chunks of code. Currently, babun comprises the following plugins:cacertcoregooh-my-zshpactcygdrivedistshellSelf-update is at the very heart of babun! Many Cygwin tools are simple bash scripts - once you install them there is no chance of getting the newer version in a smooth way. You either delete the older version or overwrite it with the newest one losing all the changes you have made in between.Babun contains an auto-update feature which enables updating both the microkernel, the plugins and even the underlying cygwin. Files located in your home folder will never be deleted nor overwritten which preserves your local config and customizations.Babun features an silent command-line installation script that may be executed without admin rights on any Windows hosts.To setup proxy uncomment following lines in the .babunrc file (%USER_HOME%\.babun\cygwin\home\USER\.babunrc)Babun has a pre-configured git. The only thing you should do after the installation is to add your name and email to the git config:There‚Äôs a lot of great git aliases provided by the git plugin:Babun is shipped with pact - a Linux like package manager. It uses the cygwin repository for downloading packages:Here‚Äôs the list of all pact‚Äôs features:The zsh (with .oh-my-zsh) is the default babun‚Äôs shell.Executing the following command will output your default shell:In order to change your default shell execute:The output contains two lines: the previous default shell and the new default shellExecute the following command the check the configuration:By executing this command you can also check whether there is a newer cygwin version available:It will check if there are problems with the speed of the git prompt, if there‚Äôs access to the Internet or finally if you are running the newest version of babun.The command will output hints if problems occur:On each startup, but only every 24 hours, babun will execute this check automatically. You can disable the automatic check in the ~/.babunrc file.You can tweak some config options in the ~/.babunrc file. Here‚Äôs the full list of variables that may be modified:To update babun to the newest version execute:Please note that your local configuration files will not be overwritten.The 'babun update' command will also update the underlying cygwin version if never version is available. In such case babun will download the new cygwin installer, close itself and start the cygwin installation process. Once cygwin installation is completed babun will restart.Startup screenPact - package installationPact - package installedBabun oh-my-zsh - auto-updateVIM syntax highlightingNano syntax highlightingGit aliases - git lgGit aliases - git stShell promptBabun updateOpen Babun here - Context MenuThe project consists of five modules.The main goal of the babun-packages module is to download the cygwin packages listed in the conf/cygwin.x86.packages file.
The above mentioned packages will be downloaded together with the whole dependency tree. Repositories which the packages are downloaded from are listed in the conf/cygwin.repositories file. At the beginning the first repository is taken, if a package is not available in this repo the second repo is used, etc. The process continues until all packages have been downloaded.All downloaded packages are stored in the target/babun-packages folder.The main goal of the babun-cygwin module is to download and invoke the native cygwin.exe installer. The packages downloaded by the babun-packages module are used as the input - all of them will be installed in the offline cygwin installation.It is not trivial to install and zip a local instance of Cygwin - there are problems with the symlinks as the symlink-file-flags are lost during the compression process. Babun can work it around though. At first, just after the installation, the symlinks_find.sh script is invoked in order to store the list of all cygwin‚Äôs symlinks. This file is delivered as a part of the the babun‚Äôs core. Then, after babun is installed from the zip file on the user‚Äôs host the symlinks_repair.sh script is invoked - it will correct all the broken symlinks listed in the above mentioned file.Preinstalled cygwin is located in the target/babun-cygwin folder.The main goal of the babun-core module is to install babun‚Äôs core along with all the plugins and tools. install.sh script is invoked during the creation of the distribution package in order to preinstall the plugins. Whenever babun is installed on the user‚Äôs host the install_home.sh script is invoke in order to install the babun-related files to the cygwin-user‚Äôs home folder.Preinstalled cygwin with installed babun is located in the target/babun-cygwin folder.The main goal of the babun-dist module is to zip the ready-made instance of babun, copy some installation scripts and zip the distribution.Distribution package is located in the target/babun-dist folder.This module contains documentation written in ASCIIDOC.The project is regularly build on Jenkins, on a slave node featuring the Windows Server OS. The Windows OS is required to fully build the distribution package as one of the goals invokes the native cygwin.exe installer. The artifacts created by each module are cached/stored in the target folder after a successful build of each step. This mechanism is not intelligent enough to calculate the diffs so if you would like to fully rebuild the whole dist package make sure to invoke the clean goal before the package goal. For now it‚Äôs not possible to invoke a build of a selective modules only.In order to build the dist package invoke:In order to clean the project target folder invoke:In order to publish the release version to bintray invoke:The release goal expects the following environment variables: bintray_user and bintray_secretEvery plugin has to consist of three main files:install.sh - a file that will be executed during the creation of the babun‚Äôs distributioninstall_home.sh - a file that will be executed during the installation of babun to the user‚Äôs home folderplugin.desc - a plugin description that contains the plugin_name and plugin_version variablesstart.sh (optional) - a file that will be executed on babun startupexec.sh (optional) - a file that allows adding commands to babun scriptHave a look at the pact plugin - it‚Äôs a perfect example of a relatively small plugin using all the features.Its main responsibility is to install the plugin - for example to copy the plugin files to, e.g. /usr/local/etc or /usr/local/bin directories. install.sh script is also responsible for preparing the user‚Äôs home folder template. The template files have to be copied to the /usr/local/babun/home/<plugin_name> folder.install.sh will be invoked many times - on every plugin update if the plugin version is higher than the version of the installed plugin - thus it‚Äôs logic has to work in an incremental way. This mechanism is invoked automatically though. The plugin does not have to contain the version check.The script has to begin with the following statement:Its main responsibility is to configure the user‚Äôs home folder with the plugin related stuff, if necessary. For example, it may copy the files from the /usr/local/babun/home/<plugin_name> folder to the user‚Äôs home folder.
It is also responsible for any other things that may be necessary during the user‚Äôs home configuration process.install_home.sh will be invoked many times - on every plugin update if the plugin version is higher than the version of the installed plugin - thus it‚Äôs logic has to work in an incremental way.Both scripts (install.sh and install_home.sh) scripts have to begin with the following statement:Its responsibility is to cleanup all entries that a plugin may leave for example on the filesystem or in the windows registry.A plugin descriptor looks like this:Every time the plugin is changed the version has to be incremented. Otherwise the newest version will not be installed.The start.sh is an optional script for plugins that require triggering certain actions on every babun start (for example update check).If the plugin folder contains an exec.sh script,
whenever babun <plugin_name> xxx yyy command is invoked, the execution is passed to <plugin_name>/exec.sh script with params xxx yyy.
In this way a plugin may add some additional shell commands without implementing its own /usr/local/bin/xxx script.The babun‚Äôs repository contains three main branches:master - development branchcandidate - release candidate branch, no direct commits, only fast forwards from the master/other branchrelease - release, no direct commits, only fast forwards from the candidate branchIn order to check babun update against other branch (for example during a development of a plugin), set the babun_branch variable to (master or candidate). External repo‚Äôs are not supporter (this mechanism has to be extended to include user‚Äôs repos).An instance of babun installed in Cygwin is located in the /usr/local/etc/babun folder.
The folder structure looks like this:The folder contains the sources of babun checkout from github.The folder contains files which modification time indicates certain things to babun. For example babun check is executed automatically on babun‚Äôs start up every 24 hours. Whenever it‚Äôs invoked a file named checked is being modified (the content of the modification does not matter).Whenever the mod_time of this file is not within 24 hours and babun is being started a babun check will be invoked and the file check located in the stamps folder will be modified again.The folder contains files that indicated which versions of babun‚Äôs plugins and babun itself are installed. Each file contains a number - for example: a file named core contains has one line with number 2 in its content. It means that the plugin core is installed and has version 2The folder contains external resources, like cloned repos of other projects (for example oh-my-zsh).The folder contains folders named like plugins. If a plugin needs to install something to user‚Äôs folder this content has to be copied to home/<plugin_name> folder. It‚Äôs just a store of the user‚Äôs home files, so that whenever a new user‚Äôs account is created babun can install user‚Äôs home related content to the user‚Äôs home folder (it‚Äôs the plugin install_home.sh script‚Äôs responsibility, however, to copy this content to the actual user‚Äôs home folder).The source code located in the babun‚Äôs repository is published under the Apache License, Version 2.0, January 2004 if not stated otherwise.Since the distribution (zip) package contains the Cygwin‚Äôs DLLs the distribution package is licensed under the GPLv3+ licence to satisfy the Cygwin‚Äôs licensing terms (http://cygwin.com/licensing.html).Special thanks go to companies who provided free hosting!XCLOUD.ME provided a free hosted OS X instance (a free Xcloud Mini Server subscription).

293,6737886,How to fail at white labelling a service,http://wpcurve.com/white-label-failure/,2013,"‚ÄòWhite label‚Äô is when another business on-sells your service and they get the kudos.We‚Äôve spent 4 months trying to white label our WordPress support service to agencies, developers and hosting companies.This post will outline the challenges we faced with white label and we hope it‚Äôs useful for you in your business.¬†As a bonus, we‚Äôll reveal our final revenue at the end of the post‚Ä¶ spoiler: it‚Äôs depressing.Let‚Äôs get started!Trying to be all things to all people will make you lose focus. We already struggle with focus, so when we tried the white label model, we introduced a massive distraction we didn‚Äôt need.Focus is the core reason why our business has started to gain traction.We‚Äôve locked in our price point, said no to thousands of dollars of web design work that doesn‚Äôt fit our model and doubled down on our core offering.If introducing a new customer type feels like it will be a distraction, go back to what works. If your service solves a problem, you will get customers.‚ÄúLack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four hour days.‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Zig Ziglar24/7 WordPress support. Unlimited fixes. $69 per month. Simple!Each web agency we spoke to had different needs. Some wanted chat support only. Another wanted monthly maintenance and maybe a few fixes. The majority wanted larger project work.Agency owners have different problems than our core customers. They mostly wanted cheaper development and to pay per project. This transformed a simple offering into a very complex agreement. We struggled with different price points, different needs and articulating exactly who would do what work.If you can‚Äôt explain the problem that your business solves to your customer, you‚Äôve got a problem.Keep it simple.‚ÄúLife is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.‚Äù ‚Äì ConfuciusA quick way to blow away your assumptions is to ask your customers what they really care about. We do this frequently and it keeps us on our toes.When you put an intermediary between yourself and the end customer, you don‚Äôt get the opportunity to build a relationship or improve your understanding of your customer‚Äôs needs.When you take the time to find out what matters to a customer, you can do more of what makes them happy and less of what they don‚Äôt care about. This customer feedback helps us to build plugins¬†and create useful content that people actually use and share.Your customer feedback loop is critical ‚Äì don‚Äôt overlook it!¬†Understanding what customers want is critical to your success.‚ÄúA satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all.‚Äù ‚Äì Michael LeBoeufWe tried to tailor our WordPress support service to fit agencies needs and by default, were forced into a position of compromise.When you work in a grey area with a completely different type of customer, your back will be against the wall as you try to force your way out by compromising on your core offering.When you actively seek your ideal customer, it‚Äôs simple: they will pay or they won‚Äôt.You don‚Äôt need to be desperate. If you have a good product or service, people will pay.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt compromise yourself. You are all you‚Äôve got.‚Äù ‚Äì Janis JoplinWe solve problems for business owners. We save them from wasting time on their WordPress site. We reduce their stress. We help them when they need it.In a white label arrangement, the problem changes. We solve a financial problem for an agency. Most established agencies have developers who fix WordPress problems, but our differentiator is to do it faster and better, because it‚Äôs all we do. The agencies we spoke to weren‚Äôt interested in our ¬†speed or the quality of our work. They were laser focused on price, because they can keep doing what they do and ¬†retain their customers.When your core differentiator becomes price, you‚Äôre in trouble‚Ä¶ unless your name is Jeff Bezos and you run Amazon.Solve the problems that your core customers have, everything else is noise.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight the problem, decide it.‚Äù ‚Äì George C. MarshallThere‚Äôs a fancy term for making a mess of your own market ‚Äì it‚Äôs cannibalization.The overwhelming response when we explain our service to some people, but in particular agencies and developers is:‚ÄúWTF? How do you actually provide unlimited fixes for $69 per month?‚ÄùThere‚Äôs no secret to our business model, it‚Äôs in the open. We focus on WordPress support. That‚Äôs it. No SEO. No PPC. No design.¬†This makes some people very uncomfortable, which is OK. If they can‚Äôt understand the model, that‚Äôs also OK. We‚Äôre not going to force it.The problem lies in the fact that we are competing with the agencies we were trying to pitch to. That‚Äôs a hard sell.Consider how long it takes to establish a good business relationship with a website client who‚Äôs had bad experiences and been overcharged by a few dodgy developers.¬†It‚Äôs completely fair that agencies wouldn‚Äôt hand over their client sites, there‚Äôs a lot of trust involved.Put yourself in the white label partner‚Äôs shoes and you‚Äôll quickly realize if there‚Äôs product / market fit.‚ÄúCompetition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer, but is the incentive to progress.‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Herbert HooverThe sales cycle for a white label customer is waaay longer than for a small business owner.A white label customer will seek input from their business partners or want to see a proposal. On the other hand, a small business customer will make a decision which is based on whether our service is a good fit or not.I spent 2 hours on the phone and worked through a thread of 45 emails before I was turned down by an agency owner for a whitelabel agreement.Our ideal customer visits our homepage, reviews our blog, reads some content and compares our offering to the alternatives. If our service makes sense, the deal is done. BOOM! Instant sign up ‚Äì they get access to us, we get paid and everyone is happy.In the early days, our assumption was that it would be much easier to sign up 1 agency with 20 customers, than sign up 20 individual businesses. That was wrong. Dead wrong.The other area that will be impacted is your motivation ‚Äì it‚Äôs disheartening to spend weeks trying to sign up an agency with no result. Every business owner we sign up brings us closer to our goal and boosts our motivation.‚ÄúSometimes thinking too much can destroy your momentum.‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Tom WatsonCustomer testimonials are gold.Here‚Äôs a shining example of a customer testimonial, directly from our amazing client ‚Äì Selena Tan.‚ÄúEver get driven nuts by niggling website issues or changes you want to make that take up too much of your time, or that you simply don‚Äôt want to deal with?

Value is what you get.‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Warren BuffettIn a past life, I was a IT consultant for large Australian companies. One thing I learned was that when everything is going well, you don‚Äôt hear a peep from anyone, good or bad. However, when something goes wrong ‚Äì you need to drop everything to fix a non-urgent issue.Based on our lengthy conversations with a number of agency owners, we realized that supporting agency clients who are paying a substantial monthly retainer would be difficult and is not a position that looks very comfortable.If you feel like your client is going to have unrealistic expectations, set them up front.‚ÄúPersonal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success.‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Denis WaitleyThere is a lot of financial risk borne by a service provider who has one or two big clients.Financial certainty helps me sleep at night, so if 30% of our revenue was at risk every day‚Ä¶ well, I wouldn‚Äôt be getting much sleep.Barring catastrophe, it‚Äôs unlikely that a large percentage of your customer base is going to churn over the course of a month, let alone a day.Try not to be seduced by the siren‚Äôs song of a big payday, as you might find yourself on the rocks!‚ÄúIt is better to risk starving to death then surrender. If you give up on your dreams, what‚Äôs left?‚Äù ‚Äì¬†Jim CarreyThe net benefit to our business was $49 revenue for a single one-off fix for an agency. During that time we signed up 100 businesses for our standard service.The lessons learned are priceless.If you‚Äôve read this far, Dan and I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below, on white label and if it‚Äôs worked for you.Each week we send 1 email to 20,000 smart entrepreneurs just like you.

I would be happy to sell your services without the white label because it allows me to focus on higher-value services, and pass on the value of what you do to clients without having to worry that I‚Äôll take all the heat if something goes wrong.

I run a similar service to WP Curve and have been approached with white label requests several times now. I have decided against it thus far and your post validates my decision. I wish you guys the best with your current strategy!Good stuff David, I‚Äôm glad it was useful. Sounds like we saved you some time ha.I‚Äôm one of those who asked David for white label services (hi David!) and I completely respect his decision not to offer it. So glad you publicised your learnings on this one Dan, transparency breeds respect in these situations. I‚Äôm now on the look out for a VA to help me support maintenance in my own business as it grows. Perhaps a pool of WordPress maintenance VA‚Äôs is the next best thing to white label. Thoughts?I think there are a lot of ideas in this space that could work if someone wanted to try. Another one would be a live support service for actual developers. We get enquiring from devs all the time but they aren‚Äôt a good fit for us.As in emotional support? üòâ Haha, but truly, I think that‚Äôs a great idea. There are services (such as Clarity) where that space could be expanded on with a more niche emphasis. Meanwhile, a hotline of counselors just for devs ‚Äì awesome!
(sorry to side track your article, have a rad day)Ha true. We actually have a lot of devs who are working at home and have done the online training but just need help with a really specific problem. We‚Äôve definitely got some who are prepared to pay a monthly fee to have someone available to help. Most I think just want a quick answer. Someone like Stack Exchange could monetize with a service like that very easily. Devs aren‚Äôt our audience though.Hi Alex, thank you for sharing this.

 If  you are not selling or
doing something unique or even being one of the leading providers, this is a
a LOSING STRATEGY, and ZERO SUM GAME that agencies would decimate.The Focus should be DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPETITION AND CLAIMS SHOULD STAND OUT in a very meaningful way, this is very hard to achieve using a White Label Strategy‚Ä¶Thanks for the comment @jamesalbis:disqus ‚Äì I feel like you are YELLING, though :SYep there is definitely a lot of that James.Solid post Alex. Funny, randomly ran across this post in a google search (don‚Äôt ask me which one)‚Ä¶ and earlier today a client of ours mentioned wpcurve to me in a separate convo. You guys are getting around! So, at my startup, Carrotly‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve had bouts with people wanting to whitelabel our WP based inbound online marketing website platform over the past year.  It was really tempting when people say ‚ÄúI want to get 300 customers in the doors‚Äù (blah) and all you initially see is the dollar signs. But, I made a strategic decision very early on about what we‚Äôre building here at Carrotly. That our brand and core values are very important‚Ä¶. that having full control over the ability to deliver an insane customer experience is huge to us‚Ä¶ and we want our product name to be seen as the only viable choice in the market for what we do.Whitelabel just wouldn‚Äôt let us do any of that to the level I wanted. ‚Ä¶ and a person who closed shop 4 years ago with a very similar (but outdated) product to the same market place, his business model was 100% whitelabel (every big player in our market at that time was using his website builder as a whitelabel, for their clients). They got his margins really slim‚Ä¶ piled in 1k+ customers in less than 8 months‚Ä¶ and it was a nightmare for the customer, the company, everyone involved. I really feel for our company, we‚Äôll never do a whitelabel because we lose control over the full customer experience and we dilute our own brand power in the marketplace. But what has worked man is this‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ there are still some great agency type relationships who are a fit and have our core values and who love our product. We started pitching to them a ‚Äúmanaged user‚Äù type service where we created a higher level of our software where they can get an account where they can create accounts for their clients to build their lead generation websites with our system. Everything is still fully branded w/ our company, the customer fully knows the service is provided by ‚ÄúInvestorCarrot‚Äù (so that gives us an endorsement right there to the marketplace), they interact directly w/ our support, etc. The agency loves it because we just invoice them monthly for the # of active users they have and we take care of 100% of the support (which we love because we can wow the clients and the interactions always lead to more sales opportunities). It‚Äôs working great now.  Just need to find those agency type clients who actually value wpcurve for not ‚Äúwhat‚Äù you are‚Ä¶ but ‚Äúwho‚Äù you are. They love your core values, love your service, love what you‚Äôre about‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôre proud to put right there front and center in their product offering ‚ÄúInstant WP Support by WPCurve‚Äù rather than thinking their customers give a crap if its provided directly by them.  So I wouldn‚Äôt ditch the agency type setup‚Ä¶ instead, keep building up your expertise in this industry and keep gaining that traction. Become the industry‚Äôs leading expert on instant WP support fixes‚Ä¶ so agency‚Äôs value your service more and would love to forget about whitelabeling‚Ä¶ and instead put ‚ÄúPowered by WPCurve‚Äù. Nice profit center and builds your brand directly in your core skillset. I can let you know how we did it on pricing so we‚Äôre netting the exact same per user w/ our agency clients vs. a sale on our website‚Ä¶ just hit me up anytime man! Keep up the great work! I LOVE your concept!Hey Trevor thanks man interesting stuff. We come back to this all the time because to this day we are turning down agencies, whitelabel and even multi site clients on an almost daily basis. Our main issue for now is still focus, our core business is growing quickly and we don‚Äôt want to lose focus there. We‚Äôve more or less decided to do exactly what we are doing until we hit our next goal of $83k / month. Once we get there I think we will come back to these things and see what we can do. This higher level user idea is an interesting one for sure. Stay in touch.I love the focus man! Thats where we are as well. We‚Äôve been turning down higher dollar one-off sales and even monthly retainer consulting gigs w/ people in our target market‚Ä¶ for the same reasons as you guys. Focusing in on our core which is our SaaS plans. We launched this startup spring of last year, and it‚Äôs crazy how when you start to get momentum rolling‚Ä¶. things start growing fast. We‚Äôre about to hit a big milestone for us (1,000 active subscription members) and our nex rev goal is the same as yours right now. Hit just over $65k last month. It‚Äôs really weird‚Ä¶. since we‚Äôre not doing any active marketing (much like you guys. It‚Äôs content marketing, SEO, word of mouth, and some affiliates)‚Ä¶ the last few months I keep going into the next month thinking‚Ä¶ ‚Äúman, how are we going to do better than last month?‚Äù . And every month this summer somehow it just works out where the company grew. Just having that milestone goal of the $1mm/yr run rate in of itself is huge because it almost puts it out there to the world what your intentions are‚Ä¶. and you figure out ways to get there. Man, the $83k/mo level for you guys will be just the start for you. When we started I thought we‚Äôd be golden when we hit 1,500 active members and we‚Äôd take the software and go into a different vertical to grow‚Ä¶. but now I‚Äôm seeing how darn large the market is we‚Äôre currently in‚Ä¶ and seeing 1,500 actives as just the start. You guys will see the same. Huge market. Good luck man!Thanks man wow exciting. SAAS is a winner, the margins and scale are unbeatable. We are with you re verticals. We haven‚Äôt even considered going outside of where we are for now and I don‚Äôt think it will be necessary for years if at all.Hi Dan and Alex. When does a mantra that guides daily decisions and keeps them on track become a dogma that impedes progress? We have a number of clients who have outsourced their marketing to us. That‚Äôs a little different from an agency model ‚Äì we can discuss if you want ‚Äì as they are buying labour, not project outcomes. These are small growth companies who can‚Äôt afford a full time marketer and one of our guys becomes a member of their team, but perhaps 1-2 days a week. sometimes onsite, sometimes at our office. Always we are their team, not an agency where you go to get great things done.What DOES make us look like an agency to you is that the clients give us a monthly budget for everything (lists, web, research, copy, ebook development, social, sales collateral, much more ‚Äì everything an in-house person would do, usually about 40 tactics) and its up to the marketer to spend that budget according to agreed priorities we negotiate every month. So this means the fees for agencies (web, development, telemarketing), or in your case site maintenance, comes out of our budget, so we pay it. When we do, we are acting AS the client, not FOR the client. Our appointed marketer usually has an email address from tat client, but sometimes we‚Äôre more transparent than that and use our own company‚Äôs email address.I read through Alex‚Äôs post (wow, how well was that thought through and articulated?) and not one of the 11 lessons hold: Without going chapter and verse, let me highlight how none of those otherwise-valid tests applied.I heard Dan on a podcast (I think it was tropical MBA, but might have been startups for the rest of us) and had exactly the customer-reaction you were looking for: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what we need for [company name]‚Äù. As is, no change in terms, not ‚Äòcheap web labour‚Äô but site maintenance from time to time for our site as you envisage, transparent to the client, you be the hero, ask for a testimonial if you want, feel free to speak to the client directly (might be we answer the phone though ‚Äì haha). And if you want to understand where the company is going so you can shape future services, go right ahead ‚Äì they will likely ask me to take the call though because that‚Äôs my job on their team. I want the same thing for our own site after we move to WP in June.When we tried to subscribe, we were rejected. Ouch!Like you both, and others who have supported your view on this post, I believe your simple business model is a key to your current and future success. Your focus on a single buyer type is likewise smart, and lets you keep your model simple (great reinforcer). I wish we could get half of our clients to buy that too.Somewhere between your strategy and its execution though, is it possible that mantra has become dogma?Independent of whether you ‚Äòlet us in‚Äô, I‚Äôd enjoy the discussion as I‚Äôve listened to / read enough to know that your views are interesting and well thought through.Great post! There are so many parallels to our business ‚Ä¶ you did a great job listing them all out and explaining them.We have been selling white label WordPress development services since April 2013 when we hired our first developer and we just made offers to our 13th and 14th developers this week. We have been successful offering fixed price quotes for what amounts to PSD-to-WordPress work as well as ‚Äúrenting‚Äù developers to other agencies for an hourly rate and having the agencies manage those developers directly via Skype, Basecamp, email, etc.Expectation setting and communicating requirements are clearly the biggest challenge we face. We provide a custom quote for each fixed price project and communicating what‚Äôs included in that price is an ever-evolving situation. Even given the standardization that WordPress brings to the table as a platform, we are still working on a custom product with one or more distant project team members (PM‚Äôs, designers, etc.) ‚Äì no mean feat. What we are working on right now is creating a customer profile that will allow us to clearly communicate to any one of our developers who might be assigned a project what each client expects. Not just simple stuff like they prefer Bootstrap vs Foundation or they like CF7 vs Gravity Forms ‚Ä¶ we are getting into cataloging more elaborate requirements like Client ABC wants the phone number, email address and street address of the customer created as a single widget so their customer vs Client XYZ who wants that same info captured as custom posts.Thanks Allen yeah projects are always going to be tricky. I chatted to a guy the other day who does only white label services as well, very similar business to yours. It seems he has been able to make it work as well. We might look at it again when we are bit more stable but we are still growing quite well without it so there‚Äôs no real point in complicating things.Brilliant post Alex. A wealth of experience there, generously shared. Your points highlight the importance for a venture to be crystal clear on their business model, end customer, how you‚Äôll reach them and your value proposition to them. White labelling can work for some (depending on business model), but you‚Äôve highlighted the importance of staying true to your core business model.Regarding Focus and Turning Down High-Paying Gigs:I understand that in order to maintain focus during the launch of your service, you had to decline large projects. After all, in the beginning, there were just 2-3 of you. Makes sense.However,  now that you have more help (and a solid recruitment system), why not experiment with larger projects as ‚Äúsides of gravy‚Äù? Not necessarily white label projects either. Perhaps you can treat it as a pilot program.You hand over the reigns. Have a new guy recruit and manage a small freelance team to do the work. Meanwhile, you and the core team remain focused on your core WP services. Use the extra revenue for one-off expenses (e.g., servers, office build-outs), and/or invest it as capital, cash reserves, and so on. If you keep it separate,  then no late night worries about losing large chunks of operating revenue from one client. If the ‚Äúsides of extra gravy‚Äù start interfering‚Ä¶then you either ramp up the freelance team, or simply end the pilot.  Easier said than done, of course! Thank you for all your contributions to the WP community! Hey Blaine thanks for the comment mate. No we won‚Äôt be doing larger projects. You can read about my philosophy around creating high growth companies in a few places:1.  This post http://wpcurve.com/saying-no/

3.  This presentation I did at WordCamp http://wpcurve.com/build-a-wordpress-business/
4.  This interview http://wpcast.fm/wpcurveI hope that clarifies my position. In short I believe there is far more opportunity in building something simple, recurring in a big market than there is in doing projects. I think people thought I was crazy at first but I am pretty confident WP Curve will grow into a much more valuable business by doing it this way.It‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶why can‚Äôt you just tell agencies and everybody else that the service is what it is and that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶And if they want it, they buy it, and if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt. I actually think part of the problem here was that YOU were trying to change yourselves to adapt to the agencies, and then not liking the results, and so then banning every future service provider. I provide marketing services to my clients and am just looking for somebody who can make website updates when needed, and would purchase the wpcurve solutions, just like any other customer would‚Ä¶But because you guys have had these problems with other agencies (which came, again, from trying to change your services to fit their needs), you will not take me on as a client, even if I act like every other client of yours (albeit with more websites). I really think this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Let anybody who wants to purchase your services, as they stand. Treat them just like every other customer. Don‚Äôt change for them because they are an agency or a service provider‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt ban them because of it either. My 2 cents.Agreed ‚Äì why can I not use this service, just as all of your other clients would, just because I‚Äôm acting on behalf of a client??great article, almost saved me from ruining my product and service. Just read in time.It‚Äôs been our experience that offering a white label web design service is a lot of hard work. More than what one would imagine. Partners take some time to learn how to brief, get info from their clients, and respond to queries. And in line with the experience of many white label partners it‚Äôs expected to be for next to nothing. But after some time one can train the partners and build a business. Anyway that‚Äôs what we have experienced."
294,6986310,Trading Gold For Bitcoins: Dubious Trade Or Digital Trend?,http://www.ibtimes.com/trading-gold-bitcoins-dubious-trade-or-digital-trend-1522516,2013,"The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.    Bitcoin enthusiast Mike Caldwell poses in his office in Sandy, Utah, September 17, 2013. Photo: Reuters  Sellers of the world‚Äôs favorite precious metal may start accepting bitcoin in exchange for their gold, driven by investment interest in China and a desire to integrate digital sales.Nevada‚Äôs Anthem Vault, which sells gold and silver bullion, already accepts bitcoin payments of up to $5,000 per day per account, company CEO Anthem Blanchard told IBTimes.Smaller gold startups, like e-commerce precious metals retailer CBMint,¬†plan to accept bitcoin by the second quarter of 2014.Bitcoin payments will help CBMint avoid payment-processing fees and may attract gold buyers who are wary of government-backed currencies, CBMint Chief Financial Officer Chris Martinez told IBTimes in an email.‚ÄúWhile many of our competitors in the precious metals retail space are behind the times, we believe that bitcoin will become a standard for online commerce,‚Äù he said. CBMint launched in November,¬†aiming to fuse e-commerce with precious metals retailing.‚ÄúAs for the risks, they don‚Äôt worry us. Bitcoin is volatile right now, but the hedging options available are getting better every day. The regulatory environment is also uncertain, but we are keeping our ear to the ground with regards to new legislation.‚ÄùAnthem Vault accepts bitcoin partly because there‚Äôs no risk of bad payments, unlike risky debit and credit card payments, especially crucial for large orders of gold and silver.Market synergy in China, the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin market¬†and likely the world‚Äôs top consumer of gold in 2013,¬†is another key attraction. China hosts BTC China, the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume.‚ÄúGiven the [foreign] exchange controls in place in China and Chinese affinity to gold as a store of value, I think there is much potential,‚Äù wrote Blanchard in an email. His company plans an international push in the first quarter of 2014, including in China, and has sold $1 million worth of inventory since its April 2013 launch.Both bitcoin and gold have seen wild volatility in 2013, with bitcoin tumbling more than 50 percent in one day earlier this month.¬†It has traded from over $1,000 per bitcoin to lows of $380. On Monday the digital currency traded at $732 per unit. Gold prices¬†have fallen more than 25 percent this year, to open at $1,214 per ounce in New York on Monday.BTC China stopped accepting Chinese yuan deposits earlier in December, however, reports the New York Times,¬†dealing another blow to prices.But Anthem Vault defers its exchange rate risk to processing company Coin Base,¬†said Blanchard, meaning the company is immune to bitcoin‚Äôs wild rate fluctuations.Larger precious metals sellers are more skeptical of bitcoin, though.‚ÄúWe want stability in our currencies‚Ä¶Bitcoin is not stable. Whether it‚Äôs a bubble or not, I think it‚Äôs a very dangerous form of currency,‚Äù Lear Capital CEO Scott Carter told IBTimes. Lear Capital earned $350 million in sales in 2011 and doesn‚Äôt accept bitcoin.Even if bitcoin owners may benefit from speculating on price movements, accepting bitcoin for commerce is a terrible idea, said Carter.Both bitcoin and gold are sometimes viewed as a hedge against conventional currency fluctuations. Gold is supposed to protect against inflation, which experts predicted would rise in an era of global quantitative easing but which hasn‚Äôt yet materialized in the U.S. ¬†¬†Major precious metals seller Kitco doesn‚Äôt yet accept bitcoin for its bullion and precious coins, according to its website,¬†though it keeps tabs on the currency‚Äôs exchange rate. Bitcoin has even been priced directly in gold on one website, reports¬†Business Insider.Others in the gold-for-bitcoin trade have faced banking problems. San Diego‚Äôs Coinabul, a marketplace specializing in bitcoin and gold, had bank accounts shut down in July, reports¬†Forbes. Other players in this space include Agora Commodities, which sells a silver bitcoin dollar,¬†and Gold Silver Bitcoin.¬†Anthem Vault sells gold via bitcoin in increments as small as $25.For brave but trendy entrepreneurs, bitcoin represents a major selling opportunity, despite skepticism from industry veterans.‚ÄúWe view bitcoin as the greatest opportunity in our industry since the advent of the Web,‚Äù said Martinez. He‚Äôll track bitcoin gold sales metrics to see what gold investors think of the payment channel. Gold and silver did well on Bitcoin Black Friday, reports¬†Business Insider.¬†The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy."

296,6919101,Clinton Foundation partners with climate change & global poverty startup,http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb10036880.htm,2013,"writeDate(1033);
Oakland, CA (PRWEB)
October 22, 2012
 Carbon Offsets To Alleviate Poverty (COTAP.org) today announced its partnership with the William J. Clinton Foundation, adding the Clinton Development Initiative‚Äôs (CDI) Trees of Hope project in Malawi as the fourth project to its growing portfolio of certified forestry carbon projects.  Through COTAP, individuals and organizations in the U.S. and around the world will now be able to offset their carbon emissions while also creating life-changing income for smallholder Malawian farmers.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased to welcome COTAP as our first U.S.-based partner for the Trees of Hope project, which is helping rural communities in Malawi generate incomes, address environmental challenges and sequester carbon emissions,‚Äù said Walker Morris, Director of the Clinton Development Initiative.  ‚ÄúCOTAP has a proven and longstanding commitment to poverty-alleviating carbon projects, they‚Äôre very transparent and modest about their margins, and they place the tool of carbon offsets at the fingertips of individuals as a tax-deductible donation and in increments as small as 1 tonne.‚Äù‚ÄúCOTAP is thrilled to partner with the William J. Clinton Foundation,‚Äù said Tim Whitley, COTAP‚Äôs Founder and CEO. ‚ÄúWhen individuals offset their carbon footprint through projects like CDI‚Äôs Trees of Hope, they‚Äôre not only taking action on their unavoidable, personal contribution to climate change, but they‚Äôre also addressing challenges like food security and education because many farmers include income-generating crop trees in their plantings and use their carbon finance earnings to pay for their children‚Äôs schooling fees.  COTAP was founded to connect more individuals and organizations in developed countries with this far-reaching, multi-faceted, and long-lasting philanthropic transaction.‚ÄùLaunched in 2007, the Trees of Hope project has grown to 200 community groups and spans an area of over 488 hectares.  Since the program‚Äôs inception, more than 2,000 smallholder farmers have already planted over 2 million hardwood, mango, and citrus trees which are projected to sequester 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.  The project is located in the rural Neno and Dowa districts, which have suffered from land and soil degradation historically brought about by deforestation and poor land management practices.  Malawi, in sub-Saharan East Africa, is amongst the poorest countries in the world, ranked 171th of 187 countries in the United Nations Development Programme‚Äôs 2011 Human Development Index, and annual Malawi per-capita income is an estimated $330.  When fully funded, the project has the potential to generate approximately 10 million planted trees and up to 1 million tonnes of long-term carbon dioxide sequestration over the next decade.  Because COTAP passes 90.9% of offset funds to the project, and because CDI sets aside 55% of carbon revenues for farmer payments, the partnership can generate as much as $4.95 million in earnings for participating farmers.  CDI‚Äôs Trees of Hope project is the fourth addition to COTAP‚Äôs portfolio, joining Montreal-based Taking Root‚Äôs project in Nicaragua, Kampala-based Ecotrust‚Äôs Trees for Global Benefits project in Uganda, and London-based Envirotrade‚Äôs Sofala project in Mozambique.  With every COTAP offset transaction, 90.9% of funds goes to projects and, because COTAP is a registered as a IRS 501(c)3 public charity, offset transactions are 100% tax-deductible for individuals residing in the U.S.All of COTAP‚Äôs current portfolio projects are registered under the Edinburgh, Scotland-based Plan Vivo carbon accounting standard.  With roots stretching back to a research project in Chiapas, Mexico in 1994, Plan Vivo is the longest-standing and most established forestry carbon accounting standard in the world.  Plan Vivo is also the only carbon accounting standard which always requires projects to have detailed plans for direct payments to smallholders and community groups.  Plan Vivo-accredited projects are projected to sequester over 1.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.COTAP and the Plan Vivo system enable individuals and organizations to pay rural farmers for planting and maintaining trees on under-utilized portions of their land which will result in the long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide.  Plantings and tree growth are third-party-verified and farmers are paid over time as their plantings are successfully managed according to their project plan.  Farmers‚Äô earnings from carbon credits are front-loaded and paid over a period of 7 to 10 years for carbon sequestration which is projected to take place over the course of 25 or more years.  In addition to carbon earnings, farmers also benefit from cash crops from their trees, improved food and fuel security, improved soil quality, and reduced soil erosion.COTAP‚Äôs dual mission, crowdfunding model, and tax-deductible status, together with Plan Vivo‚Äôs reach, accountability, and transparency, forms a new category of microfinance and a new category of high-performance philanthropy while doubling the number of reasons for individuals and organizations to take action on climate change.CONTACT INFORMATIONCOTAP

Launched in 2011, Carbon Offsets To Alleviate Poverty (COTAP) empowers individuals and organizations to address both climate change and global poverty by connecting their carbon emissions with accredited carbon projects which create life-changing income streams for the world‚Äôs poorest people.  Individuals from all over the United States - as well as from places like Hong Kong, South Africa, and Morocco ‚Äì are transforming their carbon emissions into wages in Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, and Nicaragua through COTAP.  Based in Oakland, CA in the U.S., COTAP is a registered IRS 501(c)3 public charity, and all of its projects are registered under the voluntary Plan Vivo standard, which is dedicated to generating not only verified emissions reductions, but also transparent and accountable income streams for the poor.  COTAP‚Äôs initial project portfolio is poised to generate over $1 million in payments to farmers who live on less than $2 per day.About the William J. Clinton Foundation
Building on a lifetime of public service, President Bill Clinton established the William J. Clinton Foundation with the mission to improve global health, strengthen economies, promote healthier childhoods, and protect the environment by fostering partnerships among governments, businesses, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and private citizens to turn good intentions into measurable results. Since 2001, President Clinton‚Äôs vision and leadership have resulted in more than 4.5 million people benefiting from lifesaving HIV/AIDStreatment;  more than 15,000 U.S. schools building healthier learning environments; more than 26,000 micro-entrepreneurs, small business owners, and smallholder farmers improving their livelihoods and communities; and more than 2 million tons of greenhouse gases cut or abated in some of the world‚Äôs largest cities. And President Clinton has redefined the way we think about giving and philanthropy through his Clinton Global Initiative (CGI).  To date CGI members have made nearly 2,300 commitments that have already improved the lives of more than 400 million people in more than 180 countries.  When fully funded and implemented, these commitments will be valued at $73.1 billion.# # #Share article on socal media or email:View article via:Questions about a news article you've read?Reach out to the author: contact and available social following information is listed in the top-right of all news releases.Questions about your PRWeb account or interested in learning more about our news services?Call PRWeb:1-866-640-6397¬©Copyright 1997-2015, Vocus PRW Holdings, LLC.

This 30-year-old millennial helped found ‚Äî and now runs ‚Äî Facebook. His net worth is estimated at more than $33 billion.In the U.S., people born between 1980 and 2000 now outnumber baby boomers, and their numbers are still growing because of immigration. This generation is already shaping American life, and in a series of stories ‚Äî largely reported by millennials themselves ‚Äî NPR will explore how this New Boom is transforming the country. There are more millennials in America right now than baby boomers ‚Äî more than 80 million of us.And I'm gonna go ahead and guess that if you're not a millennial, you kind of hate us.We seem so lazy, so entitled. We still live with our parents. We love our selfies and we're always talking about ourselves.But, here's my case: Millennials have already shaped your life.The Millennial WorldLet me start with those little screens we're always on: Millennials aren't simply users of social media. We invented it.Mark Zuckerberg, along with the inventors of Instagram and Tumblr and Snapchat, are all millennials and all millionaires. Oh, actually, Zuckerberg is worth billions.Millennials were there first. We picked it out and showed everybody else how to use it.These tools have also transformed some of the most important stories in the news.So we're all already living in a millennial world. It's connected. It's open.And it's diverse.""Forty-three percent of millennials are nonwhite,"" says Eileen Patten, a research analyst at the Pew Research Center (and a millennial herself). ""When we look at older generations ‚Äî boomers and silents ‚Äî less than 3 in 10 were nonwhite.""Because millennials look different en masse than generations past, the future is going to look different too. They've already led the country to massive shifts in opinion on social issues over the past decade.""They've led the way in terms of same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization ‚Äî majorities favor both,"" Patten says. ""They support granting citizenship to unauthorized immigrants ‚Äî about half do ‚Äî compared with lower shares among the older generations.""As a whole, millennials are progressive and accepting. And for all you've heard about crippling student debt, high unemployment, ""failure to launch"" ‚Äî we're hopeful.""[Millennials] are optimistic about their financial futures,"" Patten says.Try Something Else

Kyla Marrkand, 17, is a millennial on the younger end of the spectrum.The recession hit when many millennials were at the launch point of their careers.One of them was Ryan Koo. He got a bachelor of arts studying film in 2003, and got a job working at MTV in New York City. ""I got laid off along with 700 other people on the same day at the end of 2008,"" he says.So he moved home to Durham, N.C., and tried something else.""I started No Film School just as a personal blog,"" Koo says. ""My startup costs were like $600 I think.""Today the ads pay his New York rent. He raised $125,000 on Kickstarter for his first feature film and got grants from more old-school places like Tribeca and Sundance.Koo is one of many millennials who feel like they can make something happen for themselves.""Thirty-two percent say they currently earn enough to lead the kind of life they want. And 53 percent say they don't, but they think they will in the future,"" Patten says.That includes the millions of millennials who are still in school, including Kyla Marrkand. She's a high school senior at Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, D.C. She knows all about the tough economy and she's realistic, but she believes it's going to go well for her.""Everybody doesn't have the drive,"" she says. ""I have the drive.""The New BoomWe millennials have drive. We are optimistic.There are more than 80 million of us.Which is why the millennials at NPR are reporting on our own generation for a series we're calling #NewBoom.We won't be rehashing stereotypes. We won't be dismissive or flip. Because if we ‚Äî millennials and nonmillennials alike ‚Äî are going to understand the future of the country, we need to understand this generation.Millennials have already steered the country to a place where diplomats tweet, gay marriage is turning mainstream, and running a blog can be more financially secure than a company gig.If we've done all that before 35, get ready.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"

The End User License Agreement in the new operating system makes it clear that Windows 10 is capable of scanning user machines and prohibiting them from using any services that appear to have been obtained illegally.Section 7b of Microsoft's Services EULA (under ‚ÄúUpdates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms‚Äù) warns users that Windows 10 ‚Äúmay automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices.‚ÄùBy agreeing to these terms, Alphr.com reported, users are enabling Microsoft to sift through their files in search of the vaguely defined ‚Äúunauthorized hardware peripheral devices,‚Äù which could mean anything from modified Xbox controllers to unauthorized versions of Microsoft Office.What's more clear is that corporate patience with pirated games and software is running out. Video game makers have increasingly required users to input an activation code that comes with purchased copies of the game before they're allowed to play online, limiting the appeal of a pirated copy. Adobe, in response to seemingly endless Photoshop piracy, recently unveiled a subscription-only version of the popular editing software, only to have that pirated and redistributed within a day of its release.Microsoft has yet to publicly clarify what its EULA actually means, but this update is just the latest bone of contention for users concerned about their privacy.

304,7564755,Kettlebell Workout Is The Latest Fitness Craze. Have you tried it?,http://www.fitneass.com/kettlebell-workout/,2014,"There are always new workouts taking over the world of fitness. The kettlebell workout is quickly becoming the preferred option over traditional dumbbell workouts. You have most likely seen a kettlebell at your gym and wondered what you could possible do with such a large object. The kettlebell workout is designed to be intense and help you burn more than 300 calories in less than 20 minutes. This is a workout designed to help you sculpt your body and strengthen your muscles in target areas.Here is some more information on the kettlebell workout:The most impactful part of the kettlebell workout is the actual design of the kettlebell. The kettlebell does not distribute weight evenly and this helps to make this type of workout even more challenging. This means that your muscles must work much harder to stabilize the kettlebell, which only increases the effectiveness of the kettlebell workout. You can add definition to your arms, shoulders, and core, but you can also lose weight in your stomach.The kettlebell workout is designed to work out your entire body. You are instructed to complete each exercise in succession without a break in between. You only rest in between circuits for about 2 minutes. It is important to keep up with the kettlebell workout each week and do it at least 3 times. When performing this workout you must use a 10 to 15 pound kettlebell with the unique design.One of the most popular exercises in the kettlebell workout is the move around body pass. This exercise involves holding the kettlebell in front of you and releasing one hand to move the kettlebell behind you and then forward again. This exercise around your back is one rep and you do it for at least 10 before stopping for a rest. This will work out your arms, shoulders and back.Another great exercise in the kettlebell workout is the dead lift. You place the kettlebell on the ground and then move from a standing position to a squatting position to lift it. It is important to keep your back flat at all times and push into your heels as you rise. This movement is one rep and you complete about 10 before a rest.

Panic has set in on China's share markets as traders call in investors' margins loans.The main index, the Shanghai Composite, has plunged by 30 per cent since its peak in the middle of June, the biggest three-week fall in more than 20 years.The value of Chinese stocks has plunged by at least $US2.8 trillion ($3.7 trillion).A new crackdown on market manipulation and mis-selling of investment products by the securities regulator has failed to stop the falls.That has prompted fears of a share market crash in China but analysts in Australia are playing down the risks.The Shanghai Composite Index has dropped by a third since the middle of June after rising around 150 per cent over the past year. It plunged by nearly 6 per cent on Friday in another volatile day of trade.But AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver is optimistic and described it as correction, not a crash.""We've already had quite a sharp fall, I don't think we'll see a crash in the Chinese share market,"" Mr Oliver told PM.""It's not dramatically overvalued.""What I think we are seeing here is a correction.""It rose too far too fast over the last 12 months, up 140 per cent, just went up there too quickly.""Chinese regulators are investigating market manipulation and short selling, when investors borrow shares to sell in the hope of buying them back at a profit.They have also said they will protect investors against what they call sales violations on investment products.This week, regulators relaxed restrictions on margin lending and cut interest rates to try and stop the share market decline.I don't think its a risk to the Chinese financial system... It is securities firms who are dominant in the margin lending sphere Chris Weston, the head of research at IG Markets, said efforts by Chinese authorities to stem the falls have not worked so far.""We're even hearing now that they are allowing people to use housing as collateral for financing, so you can really bet your house on the stock market, which sounds like it could end very much in tears,"" he said.""I think what we seeing now is a major deleveraging going through.""The stock market for me looks like it can go lower.""The big rise on Chinese share markets over the past year has been driven by the popularity of margin loans in China, loans taken out by investors to buy shares, a move encouraged by the Chinese government to develop equity markets.Some estimates put the value of margin loans at as much as $US645 billion.Traders are now calling in some of those loans because of fears that stocks are overvalued.But Huw McKay, senior international economist at Westpac, does not think it is a threat to the Chinese financial system because most margin lending is done by the private sector.""I don't think its a risk to the Chinese financial system,"" he said.""It is securities firms who are dominant in the margin lending sphere.""The core of the banking system is relatively untouched here.""

People may not realise just how much your protocol can change things but in time I'm sure they will.Mar 8, 2014Dear Mr. Nakamoto, may I just add a special thank you for your contributions to the Bitcoin protocol of the Internet and the future of money and financial information sharing. ¬†¬†Your concept of ""a distributed decentralized public ledger,"" single-handily solving several critical previously unsolved, decades old computer science puzzles, like the ""proof of work"" with consensus that secures the distributed network making trust a non-factor and allowing for decentralization, while handling the double spend issue, was ingenious.¬†And, because of its beautifully crafted p2p open source programmable platform creative new features, application programming interfaces (APIs), new Apps, and various new developments are the norm. Ongoing issues and unforeseen concerns can also be addressed by consensus, keeping Bitcoin a long-term viable protocol and marvel of distributed, shared technology that delivers on the liberatory and stateless promises that the internet held from the very beginning.¬†In my humble opinion, Bitcoin is an intellectually elegant and eloquent solution to two key social problems: it simply costs too much to move money as banks and 3rd party intermediaries have made billions in various fees, and central banks overall have done a terrible job with monetary policy, especially since fiat currencies abandoned any precious metal standard and turned into a purely debt based instrument.¬†Bitcoin is not only a system for securely and verifiably transferring bitcoin within its own secure payment system, it's a unit of measure with a public ledger that can be used to represent any number of financial instruments. Most importantly, it delivers on the dream of ‚Äúdisintermediation,‚Äù of cutting out the middleman and the associated costs for all sorts of transactions and ""decentralization,"" moving out from under the control of tyrannical central banks and domineering oppressive governments. Bitcoin is purposeful and useful because it lets people do things they couldn't otherwise do before.¬†Thanks to you the world can quite possibly be a much better, freer, and financially abundant place.Mar 10, 2014Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet. Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing Bitcoin.Sep 8, 2014

Sperm banks in China are offering men the price of an iPhone 6s in return for their donations, the Changjiang Times reports.The Renji Hospital in Shanghai is offering donors 6,000 yuan ($940) if they are willing to make regular donations.We're covering the weird and wonderful tech at SXSW, join us in the fun.While the money could be used for anything, the hospital is interestingly using the attraction of the new iPhones to lure men through the door.The hospital‚Äôs website features several images of iPhones with things like ‚Äúno need to sell your kidneys, easily have a 6s‚Äù underneath.There are some stipulations though ‚Äì donors must be at least 5ft 4‚Ä≥ in height, have a college degree and pass a full medical examination prior to being accepted. Then the men have to commit to donating 17ml of their semen within a period of six months or less before getting the full amount.So, what do you think? Would you donate your sperm to get an iPhone?

309,8130821,Android Overtakes iOS in Usage Stats for the First Time Ever,http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/08/03/android-overtakes-ios-in-usage-stats-for-the-first-time-ever/,2014,"Android has long been king when it comes to mobile market share, but despite a significantly larger install base, its usage statistics have always been below those of iOS. That‚Äôs no longer the case anymore, however, because Android usage just surpassed iOS usage for the first time ever.The latest data from Net Applications show that smartphones and tablets powered by Android were used more than iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches powered by iOS this July. While iOS usage dipped from 45.61% in June to 44.19%, Android‚Äôs increased from 43.75% to 44.62%.The gap between the two platforms is smaller than ever as far as usage is concerned, but with Android continuing to crush rival platforms in shipment volume, its overtaking of iOS has seemed inevitable for some time.It now seems unlikely that iOS will take back the top spot any time soon, though Apple is expected to attract new users to its platform with larger iPhones later this year. In addition to launching a 4.7-inch device in October, an even bigger model with a 5.5-inch display is rumored to follow.Net Applications also looks at Windows Phone usage, which increased from 1.99% in June to 2.49% in July.

310,8236186,Physicists to Test If the Universe Is a Hologram,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/27/universe-is-a-hologram_n_5720812.html,2014,"Physicists working for the US government are to test if the universe is actually a 'two-dimensional' hologram.Scientists at the US Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Lab will collect data to answer some of the strangest questions that exist about, well, existence itself.""If we see something, it will completely change ideas about space we've used for thousands of years,"" says Craig Hogan, director of Fermilab's Center for Particle Astrophysics.The hologram theory suggests that while we perceive ourselves to be living in a 3D universe with time as a fourth dimension, the reality might be quite different.Some scientists theorise that it could be possible for space-time to be 'encoded' in smaller dimensional packets, like pixels on a TV screen building to make an apparently clear image.If true, this ""space pixel"" would be about 10 trillion trillion times smaller than an atom. That's small enough to make that particle-like thing subject to the same quantum mechanical rules as other sub-atomic particles. And that opens up interesting possibilities for new types of physics - and new ways to test if the theory is true in the first place. (And for the record, yes, this theory is much more complicated that we just implied. The inclusive complexity of particle physics is, generally speaking, difficult to explain in a sentence.)In the new Holometer experiment, physicsts will tell if there are built-in limits to the information you can know about the location of objects. With the holometer (above) - or holographic interferometer - Fermi physicists will test whether space itself is vibrating, which would imply a quantum effect and so lend weight to the idea of a holographic universe.This ""holographic noise"" is tricky to find because it can be influenced or mistaken by other sources of vibration. For that reason the Holometer will test at an absurdly high frequency, so that normal vibrations wouldn't have time to make their effect felt.""If we find a noise we can't get rid of, we might be detecting something fundamental about nature‚Äìa noise that is intrinsic to spacetime,"" said Fermilab physicist Aaron Chou. ""It's an exciting moment for physics. A positive result will open a whole new avenue of questioning about how space works.""Share this slide:

The key at the moment is Congressional approval of fast-track authority. This would give any agreement a straight up or down vote on an accelerated timetable.Fast-track authority would virtually guarantee passage since members would face intense pressure from corporate contributors and the media, in both the news and opinion sections, to support the deal. Failure to support a deal would mean that a member would be labeled a protectionist Neanderthal (name-calling is standard fare in Washington when pushing for trade deals) in addition to being badly under-funded in their re-election campaign.As has frequently been noted, the TPP is not really about trade. The tariff barriers and quotas between the TPP countries are already low in most cases. Rather the point of the deal is to put in place a structure of regulations that will be more friendly to the large corporations who are in many cases directly part of the negotiating process.The provisions in the agreement will overrule measures passed by national, state, and local legislative bodies, in effect stripping democratically elected officials of much of their authority. Since most of the text is still secret we can only speculate on what the final agreement will include.The leaked chapter on intellectual property indicated that it would likely mean sharply higher drug prices in many countries since the TPP would strengthen patents and related restrictions on selling drugs. The final agreement may limit the ability of governments to regulate fracking. In the United States, federal law prohibits state and local governments from requiring disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracking process. This makes it far more difficult to detect pollution of ground water and drinking water. The TPP may include a similar provision.It may also include restrictions on the ability of governments to regulate the financial sector. This could allow banks to skirt rules in Dodd-Frank or comparable financial reform bills approved by other countries.It is likely that many of the provisions in the final agreement would be highly unpopular if they were put up for a vote, but the whole point of getting the deal as a fast-tracked take it or leave it deal is to prevent individual provisions from ever being considered. And there will be enormous pressure to take it.That is what we saw with the full court press used to pass NAFTA. And twenty years later the media and the economics profession are still covering up on the impact of NAFTA in order to avoid embarrassment to the deal‚Äôs supporters. For example the Washington Post recently wrote about Mexico‚Äôs growing middle class which it attributed in part to NAFTA. This is in spite of the fact that Mexico had the second slowest growth on any country in Latin America since the passage of NAFTA.The Washington Post also bizarrely asserted in a 2007 editorial attacking presidential candidates for criticizing NAFTA that Mexico‚Äôs GDP had quadrupled since 1988. In fact, its growth was just 83 percent.The economics profession, or at least pillars such as the World Bank, has also been prepared to make up numbers to make it appear NAFTA was a success. On the tenth anniversary of NAFTA the World Bank published a report touting the benefits of NAFTA to both the United States and Mexico.One of the key claims in this report was that NAFTA had produced faster growth in Mexico, leading to a convergence in living standards between Mexico and the United States. It is easy to see that this was not true. According to IMF data, Mexico‚Äôs per capita GDP rose by 29.1 percent from 1993 to 2002, the last year in the study. By contrast, per capita GDP had risen by 44.2 percent in the United States over the same period.Typically we would expect that a developing country would have more rapid growth than a rich country like the United States, so it would not be clear whether any convergence was due to NAFTA or would have happened regardless. However since growth in the U.S. outpaced growth in Mexico there was no convergence to argue over, the gap in incomes became larger.Nonetheless, the World Bank‚Äôs report trumpeted the success of NAFTA, showing how it led to greater prosperity for Mexico. They used a mistaken analysis to get this result, which the Bank has refused to correct to this day.This is what the opponents of the TPP can expect to encounter. All the rules of objectivity that the media claim to respect will be thrown in the dustbin.

312,6600668,"Big Newspapers Tilted In Favor Of The NSA, Study Finds",http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4148499,2013,"A new study released on Wednesday found that much of the coverage of the National Security Agency spying controversy has been weighted in favor of the surveillance agencies.The Columbia Journalism Review study examined stories from USA Today, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times over a two-month period. The results were consistent:Of the 30 traditionally pro- or anti-surveillance terms we examined...in all four newspapers, key words generally used to justify increased surveillance, such as security or terrorism, were used much more frequently than terms that tend to invoke opposition to mass surveillance, such as privacy or liberty.USA Today led the pack, using pro-surveillance terms 36 percent more frequently than anti-surveillance terms. The LA Times followed at 24 percent, while The New York Times was at 14.1 percent. Even the Washington Post, where Barton Gellman was the first US journalist to break the news of the NSA's surveillance, exhibited a net pro-surveillance bias in its coverage of 11.1 percent. Although keyword frequency analysis on its own is not always conclusive, large, consistent discrepancies of the kind observed here strongly suggest a net media bias in favor of the US and UK governments' pro-surveillance position.The study also noted that the coverage flew in the face of the American public's consistent opposition to many NSA spying programs. Other recent studies have shown similar gaps; a survey of cable news coverage of the conflict in Syria, for instance, found that news networks were far more hawkish on the issue than the public at large.Read the full findings here.Share this slide:

    			View this image ‚Ä∫Snowden‚Äôs Russian refugee document.  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersEdward Snowden has made some dangerous enemies. As the American intelligence community struggles to contain the public damage done by the former National Security Agency contractor‚Äôs revelations of mass domestic spying, intelligence operators have continued to seethe in very personal terms against the 30-year-old whistle-blower.‚ÄúIn a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American, I personally would go and kill him myself,‚Äù a current NSA analyst told BuzzFeed. ‚ÄúA lot of people share this sentiment.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would love to put a bullet in his head,‚Äù one Pentagon official, a former special forces officer, said bluntly. ‚ÄúI do not take pleasure in taking another human beings life, having to do it in uniform, but he is single-handedly the greatest traitor in American history.‚Äù That violent hostility lies just beneath the surface of the domestic debate over NSA spying is still ongoing. Some members of Congress have hailed Snowden as a whistle-blower, the New York Times has called for clemency, and pundits regularly defend his actions on Sunday talk shows. In intelligence community circles, Snowden is considered a nothing short of a traitor in wartime.‚ÄúHis name is cursed every day over here,‚Äù a defense contractor told BuzzFeed, speaking from an overseas intelligence collections base. ‚ÄúMost everyone I talk to says he needs to be tried and hung, forget the trial and just hang him.‚ÄùOne Army intelligence officer even offered BuzzFeed a chillingly detailed fantasy.‚ÄúI think if we had the chance, we would end it very quickly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust casually walking on the streets of Moscow, coming back from buying his groceries. Going back to his flat and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks it‚Äôs a parasite from the local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he dies in the shower.‚ÄùThere is no indication that the United States has sought to take vengeance on Snowden, who is living in an undisclosed location in Russia without visible security measures, according to a recent Washington Post interview. And the intelligence operators who spoke to BuzzFeed on the condition of anonymity did not say they expected anyone to act on their desire for revenge. But their mood is widespread, people who regularly work with the intelligence community said.‚ÄúThese guys are emoting how pissed they are,‚Äù Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the Brookings Institute. ‚ÄúDo you think people at the NSA would put a statue of him out front?‚ÄùThe degree to which Snowden‚Äôs revelations have damaged intelligence operations are also being debated. Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, recently called the leaks ‚Äúunnecessarily and extremely damaging to the United States and the intelligence community‚Äôs national security efforts,‚Äù and the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger said terrorists have been ‚Äúchanging their methods because of the leaks.‚Äù Snowden‚Äôs defenders dismiss those concerns as overblown, and the government has not pointed to specific incidents to bear out the claims.On the ground, intelligence workers certainly say the damage has been done. The NSA officer complained that his sources had become ‚Äúuseless.‚Äù The Army intelligence officer said the revelations had increased his ‚Äúblindness.‚Äù‚ÄúI do my work in a combat zone so now I have to see the effects of a Snowden in a combat zone. It will not be pretty,‚Äù he said.And while government officials have a long record of overstating the damage from leaks, some specific consequences seem logical.‚ÄúBy [Snowden] showing who our collections partners were, the terrorists have dropped those carriers and email addresses,‚Äù the DOD official said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt find them because he released that data. Their electronic signature is gone.‚ÄùCheck out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

314,9877986,Facebook‚Äôs security chief calls for Adobe Flash to be killed off,http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/facebooks-security-chief-calls-for-adobe-flash-to-be-killed-off-12264.html,2015,"Poor old Adobe Flash.√Ç¬†Hardly anybody seems to love it.And this isn‚Äôt a new phenomenon.Remember the controversy all those years ago, when it became clear that Apple had no plans to ever support Flash on the iPhone and iPad? The late Steve Jobs even took to his keyboard to write a lengthy explanation of why he would not allow Flash on his devices ‚Äì citing a number of reasons including battery life, reliability and security.Security is, of course, likely to be a major concern of readers of the Hot for Security blog ‚Äì and it‚Äôs true to say that Adobe Flash has been frequently targeted by online criminals who exploit flaws in the software to infect innocent people‚Äôs computers.Just last week Adobe was forced to issue a patch for yet-another zero-day vulnerability that had been spotted in several exploit kits after details of the flaw became public following the massive security breach at spyware company Hacking Team.And now Adobe has warned of two more critical vulnerabilities in Flash which are being publicly exploited. Adobe says it hopes to issue fixes for these two zero-day vulnerabilities, which could allow hackers to take control of innocent computers, sometime this week.It‚Äôs perhaps not surprising that some think it‚Äôs time for Adobe Flash to call it a day, pack its bags, and leave town for good.Amongst those who would be happy to see the back of Adobe Flash is Alex Stamos, Facebook‚Äôs newly-appointed security chief.In a tweet this weekend, Stamos ‚Äì who is a respected member of the security community who is credited for improving the security stance of Yahoo at his previous job ‚Äì said that it was time for Adobe to announce when Flash would be killed off, and for browsers to assist by dropping support at the same time.‚ÄúIt is time for Adobe to announce the end-of-life date for Flash and to ask the browsers to set killbits on the same day.‚ÄùIn a follow-up tweet, Stamos said that Adobe‚Äôs death date didn‚Äôt have to be today or tomorrow ‚Äì but a date had to be set in stone for systems to be made more secure:‚ÄúEven if 18 months from now, one set date is the only way to disentangle the dependencies and upgrade the whole ecosystem at once.‚ÄùIf Adobe Flash is ever going to be kicked to the kerb (as it seems it should be) then a date clearly needs to be declared to drive the push to a Flash-free world. It‚Äôs not just important for browsers, of course, but also for companies whose websites and in-house applications might rely heavily on the technology.The problem is that perhaps Adobe doesn‚Äôt feel happy acknowledging that securing Flash is beyond them, and so is unwilling to drop the product. The truth is that the company would probably gain a lot more respect from the internet community if it worked towards this ultimate fix for the Flash problem, rather than clinging on to the belief that it might be able to one day make Flash secure.As it is, the only people who truly seem to love Adobe Flash these days are the criminals themselves.Graham Cluley is an award-winning security blogger, researcher and public speaker.  He has been working in the computer security industry since the early 1990s, having been employed by companies such as Sophos, McAfee and Dr Solomon's.  He has given talks about computer security for some of the world's largest companies, worked with law enforcement agencies on investigations into hacking groups, and regularly appears on TV and radio explaining computer security threats. Graham Cluley was inducted into the InfoSecurity Europe Hall of Fame in 2011, and was given an honorary mention in the ""10 Greatest Britons in IT History"" for his contribution as a leading authority in internet security.Your email address will not be published.

LOL!If ‚Äòbeing unable to secure a product‚Äô is a criteria that makes it eligible for extinction, then, well, we should power off everything and take a walk in the woods. Because no widely used web tech is ever going to be exploit-free.Flash is still alive because of ‚Äòcompanies whose websites and in-house applications might rely heavily on the technology‚Äô. And there are TONS of those around. And none of them are in a hurry to drop everything and rework years of development in something else. Chrome deprecated NPAPI that Flash relies on for interfacing with browsers. But not before they developed PPAPI interface to replace it, and built-in Flash plugin that uses it. New MS browser, Edge, dropped support for untold holy cow technologies that IE was burdened with, including SIlverlight, MS‚Äôs answer to Flash. But, guess what, they decided to leave Flash support in,and not only that, but to make it built-in. What does that tell you? Flash is not going to go away any some time soon.Want me to let you in on a secret? Check it out: Adobe really *would like* to kill Flash. In fact, they stopped real work on in years ago, and been quietly neglecting it ever since. But, again, it‚Äôs too widely used, and too good at what it does for them to be able to drop it without major backlash.And, so, I can guarantee it that Flash will still be there, 18 months from now. And further.I think I and most people on the planet agree. I blame HTML 5 and it‚Äôs lack of progress as the reason it hasn‚Äôt gone already though.Another approach to get rid of this cancer would be adding it to all the AV databases as a malware and removing it from PCs. Adobe Flash is literally a piece of malware pretending to be a browser add-on.[‚Ä¶] caused in the past couple of weeks had led to Mozilla blocking the Flash plug-in in its browser and Facebook‚Äôs Security Chief to call for Flash to be [‚Ä¶]Bitdefender Total Security Multi-Device 2017

So I decided that it may be usefull for other people, too.I'm running Linux Mint 17 on a Lenovo x240 Laptop with the Alfa AWUS036NHR. The focus of this tutorial is to get the Alfa AWUS036NHR working in a virtualized Kali Linux 1.1.0 environment.But, first things first.First of all make sure you have virtualbox installed on your machine. You can do so via packetmanager or get the latest release directly from Oracle (this seems to be a descent way to do so).Important is to also install ""VM VirtualBox Extension Pack"". You need this to enable USB 2.0 support (among other things) in your Virtualbox. You can download it directly from the Virtualbox Download page.The next important step is to add yourself to the vboxusers group. Open your terminal and type:sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USERto add the current user to the group. If your not logged in as the user who is intended to use virtualbox, change $USER to the respective username.Go to the Kali download page and get the latest release of Kali (1.1.0 as of this writing). Next, open your Virtualbox and setup a new virtual machine.I don't want to go into to much detail about this, but if you plan to install Kali instead of running it live, there are certain pitfalls. If you have trouble installing Kali, here is a good resource.For the purpose of this instruction it is not nescessary to install Kali.The ""trickiest"" part is to channel the usb card through to you virtual machine. Assuming you have completed all the previous steps, open VirtualBox and go to the settings of you previously created Kali machine. Now head to the USB section.If you hit the little ""USB-plus"" sign on the right, you should see all availlable devices on your machine. But that's not what we are going to do.
Instead create a new filter with the ""USB-bubble(?)"" button and give it a generic name. We also need the product and vendor id. Go to the terminal and hit lsusb.Your output should look something like thisI have marked the two relevant values. If you have a different model or even a card from a different vendor, the process should be the same (though I have not tested it).
Now enter the values into the USB filter in Virtualbox.Done!No, seriously! That's it! You could now fire up your Kali machine and check if everything works.How to get your external networkcard to work in a virtualbox virtual machine running Kali linux.You need:and then"

Mine sure didn‚Äôt. A stark comparison to the growing epidemic of food allergies, worsening with every generation.¬† According to a study released in 2013 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food allergies among children increased approximately 50% between 1997 and 2011 (1).                								  Why your grandparents didn‚Äôt have food allergies‚Ä¶but you do Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Although it can be argued that food allergy and/or food sensitivity testing wasn‚Äôt really around back in the day and that there was much less of a focus on these concerns as a whole, there is clearly an increase of documented food allergy cases happening today. ¬†So what could be some of the reasons that your grandparents didn‚Äôt have food allergies?It‚Äôs really quite simple‚Ä¶Food came from farms and small markets in the early 1900‚Ä≤s, and because food preservatives were not widely used yet, the food was fresh. Because of the lack of processed food, their diets were nutrient dense allowing them to get the nutrition they needed from their food.For babies, breast milk was valued, and it was always in season.Our grandparents did not fall victim to fad diets, food marketing, calorie counting, and other detrimental dieting habits that are popular today (in part because the marketing infrastructure didn‚Äôt exist yet). Because of this they had a healthy metabolism and ate according to their body‚Äôs needs and cravings.Buying processed food was not an option, and eating out was a rare luxury. Lucky for our grandparents these habits actually increased their health.¬†The food was not yet treated with additives, antibiotics, and hormones to help preserve shelf life and pad the pockets of food producers in the early 1900‚Ä≤s at the expense of the consumer‚Äôs health.Animal bones were saved or bought to make broths and soups, and organ meats always had a special place at the dinner table. These foods were valued for their medicinal properties, and never went to waste.When they got a fever, they waited it out. When they felt sick, they ate soups, broths and got lots of rest. They did not have their doctor or nurse on speed dial and trusted the body‚Äôs natural healing process a whole lot more than we do today. Their food was medicine, whether they realized it or not.Try out this delicious and simple broth recipe ‚Äì Homemade Bone Broth.Our grandparents didn‚Äôt have the choice to stay inside and play on their phones, computers, and gaming systems. They played on the original play-station: ¬†bikes, swing sets, and good ol‚Äô mother nature!Nutrition affects EVERY cell in our body. The health of our cells is dependent on diet and lifestyle.¬†Cells create tissues; tissues create organs, ¬†and we are made up of a system of organs. If your nutrition is inadequate, the integrity of each cell, tissue, and organ in your body will suffer. Thus you may be MORE sensitive to certain foods.What do you think?

yeah well they also probably lived in remote communities away from populations of people who are cesspools of disease. Times have changed of course everything has. The logic of not immunizing is flawed at best at worst you are a danger to the welfare of the entire human race.
+  Reply Amy HU , viruses can mutate‚Ä¶ that's the problem. If you do not vaccinate you are endangering the welfare of your children and all the children around them so go ahead donbt vaccinate maybe your spawn would be better off not on this earth cause you are obviously to stupid to be here anyways‚Ä¶
+  Reply Amy HU, when you vaccinate against a virus the amount of people who can catch the disease is reduced meaning that the virus has less chances for mutation as it has less victims to originally infect. Do you see people dying of small pox? No because small pox was pretty much eradicated. BECAUSE OF IMMUNIZATION. I'm afraid the only propaganda believer around here is you cause everything i am talking about can be empirically proven and reproven over and over again because they are facts. Your ""viewpoints"" are just that. Peter Cassels, go look up viruses see the the little section on mutations‚Ä¶. Quit believing everything you read. Either side of the vaccination story have their own agenda to forward. They both have reasons to try to deceive so we consume their world view. I personally don't care what you believe just know what the heck you are talking about before you talk about it. I'm not the best scientist or a dr but i know enough to know that the pros of vaccine far outweigh and cons and anyone who does not believe that is a denier, and should be treated in the same way as climate change and holocaust deniers. Grant miller, actually the best places for virus to mutate is in condition where a bunch of species of animals are living in close proximity‚Ä¶. So anyone else have any stupid comments or can i go do something constructive?
+  Reply OMG you have already reproduced? Did you vaccinate? I really hope you did and arent proven wrong because those kids don't deserve to get sick from your beliefs.

+  Reply John Teresa Hoxie  anecdotal evidence is very powerful but still not real evidence. i am sorry for you and your situation, but this is not at all proven as all studies that link autism and vaccines were debunked. You are not speaking from a scientific or logical point but an emotional one and they are the least important because people will choose to believe things that are not true,. Show me evidence that he had no predisposition for autism. Show me there was no other possible cause for his diagnosis other than the vaccines and i will totally accept you story if not then kindly stop spouting rhetoric. Remember its not what you think (""know"") but what you can prove. And they have proven no link between autism and vaccines end of story.
+  Reply Martie Johnson  I drink lots of orange juice and i don't have cancer, orange juice must prevent cancer! My statement although ridiculous is still a better statement than yours, I'm afraid.
+  Reply Angela Kartischko yes but eliminating vectors for disease is the WHOLE POINT OF VACCINATION!!! Less vectors for the disease to infect means less infections. Simple math really.
+  Reply Carolyn Bryant Schaub allergies have been around a long time. Saying that these things are new is blatant stupidity. Modern science and medicine have just figured out that these are the reason people died. Back in the old days we didn't do autopsies or know basic medicine so when people died they didn't know why. Your ability to use logic and critically think are really whats at question here as well as all the other people ive responded to‚Ä¶
+  Reply Angela Kartischko  I'm sorry critical thinking is vital to navigate the minefield of scientific studies cause you as you put so well there is always a bias‚Ä¶ You think that being vaccinated isn't our natural immune system? What exactly do you think being immunized means? That statement makes me question whether or not you even know the mechanism of immunization..:/
+  Reply Lucinda Udulutch yes it was all big business not bad science‚Ä¶*roll eyes*
+  Reply Aaron Hagel ‚Äì please explain why there has yet to be any formal study of all these ""anecdotes"" of vaccine damage.  Also please explain why there has not been a long-term, placebo-controlled, large-sample study of the overall health of the vaccinated vs. the unvaccinated.  Or please produce these studies if they exist.  I hope I don't need to explain to you the circular reasoning in the argument that studying vaccinated against unvaccinated is ""unethical"" due to having to deliberately leave one group unvaccinated, which begs the question of whether vaccines are effective and/or safe. (the question we are attempting to answer)  So far everything you have said has been parroting arguments used to argue for vaccination when there is no scientific evidence to support them.  When you accused someone of ""You are not speaking from a scientific or logical point but an emotional one"" I had to laugh because that is the definition of irony.  Provide sources and sound logic, not some rumoured ""fact"" that you heard and believed.
+  Reply Chris Seal everything i have stated can easily be found by reading any number of studies i am not here to prove or disprove anything i am merely shooting down ignorant assumptions. Where is you proof? The age old cry of the person who has nothing better to say on the internets. How can i explain what i do not know I only speak from what information or knowledge is available to me. Its better than formulating opinions based on anecdotes and conjecture which most of the people who comment on these type of things do. Also there is a ton of ignorance. I have formulated my own arguments on this subject. So what are you really arguing here? What was the point of your statement my points have been very clear but you sir are all over the map. I am speaking from logical point of view because i unlike the rest of you don't really care if you vaccinate or not i'm just challenging your beliefs and how you state them. Also you have no idea what the definition of irony is obviously.
+  Reply Erika Reilly I love how you end of peace and love to all but call me a punk‚Ä¶ now that Chris Seal is irony. 
+  Reply Martin John Seers  you lost me at chemtrails I'm sorry. Believe that behind every tree the government is trying to kill you I could care less. But you are speaking of theories and such and although they are convincing in their own way i do not accept them.
+  Reply Erika Reilly  so aside from teaching Chris Seal the true meaning of irony, lets take a look at your statement. For one I am not a ""punk"" although i do like some dead kennedy's once in a while. I am not a college grad. I also unlike most people have an easily changed mind when i can be shown the error of my logic or my thoughts. The main reason is I do not believe in things, I am a skeptic. You want to sway my way of thinking? Show me evidence put forth in a well thought out and factual argument and I will listen. I do not argue for the sake of arguing. I like to challenge others beliefs. By the reactions of most here i see that you BELIEVE in this stuff you don't actually KNOW. Beliefs are for religions and ethics not science.
+  Reply Erika Reilly I agree opinions and beliefs are protected and everyone has their right to them. But here we are talking about science and when you mix the two a lot of the time you end up with horrible consequences.:) But thank you for your judgement reversal, peace and love to you as well.
+  Reply Aaron Hagel I find it ironic when you accuse others of doing exactly what you're doing (I call it irony because it's funny to me, and a little sad.  Perhaps if it made me angry I would call it hypocrisy).  You make the assumption that anyone skeptical of your view must be basing their views on belief rather than evidence yet you show very clearly that you are basing your argument on belief.  I asked for evidence and you made excuses and hurled insults.   I'm assuming since you seem to champion logic that you've studied it to some degree, so I shouldn't need to explain how your response is fallacious.  Please go back and read it, maybe after taking a few deep breaths.  The fact is, the evidence to support vaccinations is extremely weak, so the only reason people love them so much is because of BELIEF.  You were told by professors or others you trust that you should believe in vaccines, and so you do.  You clearly have not checked for yourself to be sure that you can trust this information, or you would either A) be able to support your argument with evidence and logic, or B) have a different argument.
+  Reply Chris Seal the evidence to support vaccines is weak? I have read immunological studies for and against and by process of critical thinking and elimination i have come  to the conclusion that vaccinations are better than not vaccinating. I do not believe things until i am satisfied they are accurate (or as accurate as anything can be in a world where we are still learning.) I accused you of nothing except being all over the map and not knowing what irony is, or  hypocrisy for that matter, I asked what you were arguing? You statement is directed in a such a way that i am unsure as to what you want from me. You could maybe call me a lot of things, but try not call me words you do not grasp the full meaning of. Fallacious? I'm not sure how i re read it a few times‚Ä¶ maybe again a word you are not too familiar with but are throwing around to make yourself seems smart? I do not have to defend my argument because i see no challenge to them. If you would like to continue this debate with me be more clear in what you would like to see me ""back up"" without throwing around pseudo-intellectual insults.
+  Reply Also it is difficult to formulate an argument to one persons statements when they are reading multiple of my own and i am not 100% sure which ones they are taking issue with.
+  Reply Nicolas Daignault Well you can't just do a google search and read the titles!  I said the science is weak, not that it doesn't exist.  You've got to read the actual studies, considering things like sample size, placebo-controls, availability of raw data, length of study, and conflicts of interest in funding.  As I'm sure you are aware, vaccines are given to healthy people, and they are mandatory for children in most states.  This means the burden of proof is on the vaccine-sellers, (and believers such as yourself) not the skeptical potential customers.  You are calling me irrational, yet you believe the hype.
+  Reply Aaron Hagel This is my last post to you.  I was very clear from the very start about the kind of verification I was looking for.  You are either not paying attention or trolling, so I'm through wasting time with you.
+  Reply Nicolas Daignault Thank you for the improved tone of your second comment, and for providing some sources.  I will be looking at the research you presented with an open mind (which is of course also a skeptical one).  In the meantime, I can tell you what would convince me:  a very clear and highly reliable study which uses sound logic and methodology and shows data that is convincing.  My criteria I've mentioned already ‚Äì large sample size, true placebo controls (that is, sugar water rather than another vaccine or something equally unreliable), independent funding, length of study.  I have looked at a lot of research and haven't found this one yet.  Perhaps one of your references will be the one, I am open to that.  I'll find out.  Also, I see you are in Canada, and I am unaware of the law there.  Here in the USA, vaccines are mandated for children to attend public school, which is also mandated.  In addition to that, vaccines are given to healthy people.  Either of those two facts alone makes them especially subject to a burden of proof, since it's possible they're just snake oil.  And if you read the package inserts, you see that there are verified potential side effects published (as required) by the vaccine-makers themselves.  So they're dangerous snake oil.  As for your final point, I would say that there is a third possibility, which is that scientists value their paychecks, (and their reputations) so they may be hesitant to publish information that could damage their careers.  It's not that they're incompetent or conspirators, but just human like everyone else, trying to feed their families and survive.  There's also the matter of funding:  who will pay for a truly objective study?  I should clarify that I am not ""anti-vaccine"" in the sense that I want all vaccines banned.  Instead I want freedom of choice to protect my children from possible harm in the best way I see fit.
+  Reply Nicolas Daignault Well I still haven't had a chance to do a lot of research yet here, but I have to respectfully disagree with your comment ""it is only reasonable to have public policy that mandates large-scale vaccination.""  This is fascism at worst, utilitarianism at best.  (The utilitarian philosophy is basically whatever causes the greatest good for the greatest number is the best ethical approach.)  Even if I find the studies I'm looking for, and become convinced that the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the risks for my kids, I still will not support a government mandate.  First of all, I find the utilitarian philosophy deplorable in that individuals and even minority groups are treated as expendable for the larger group.  If you can put yourself in the shoes of one of the expendable people then it should become clear why this is a problem.  It is inhuman.  Secondly, a government mandate assumes the infallibility of the government and of the scientists they consult.  When we start talking about infallibility, we're back to the subject of faith.  It is my contention, which is quite clear when you look at history, that science is an ongoing, unfolding process and when you consider that scientists 100 years ago, etc, thought THEY were the ones that had the answers, only to be either proven wrong, or vastly expanded upon.  By definition, science could not progress if its knowledge were already complete and this includes the possibility of being proved wrong.  (which has happened many times in the history of science)  If you are openly a fascist that is against civil liberties then never mind, you are being consistent with your stance.  However I find it a despicable stance.  (Or perhaps you forgot that vaccines have known, proven potential side effects, including death?

319,7988206,"A Solution To World Hunger? Breadfruit, Gluten-Free 'New Superfood'",http://www.medicaldaily.com/solution-world-hunger-breadfruit-gluten-free-new-superfood-high-carbs-and-protein-291246,2014,"How to Live Better, LongerBehavior, Neuroscience & Your BrainTechnology & the Business of MedicineHealthcare, Policy & GovernanceBreaking News and TrendsScience is Stranger Than FictionWe‚Äôve all heard the term ""superfood"" applied to fruits and vegetables because of their supposed extraordinary health benefits. These foods are considered powerful enough to help our cholesterol, combat heart disease and cancer, and to help us feel better without any side effects. Now, in an article published in New Scientist, researchers have found another superfood to add to the healthy bunch, an exotic fruit with a potato-like texture: breadfruit.The fruit, also referred to by its Latin name¬†artocarpus altilis, is widely consumed throughout the Pacific Islands and has been deemed capable of potentially feeding the world, all the while delivering a healthy dose of protein. Breadfruit is rich in vitamins and minerals and provides a gluten-free source with rich amounts of carbohydrates and protein. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one cup, or 220 grams (g) of breadfruit contains 1,070 milligrams of potassium, 60g of carbohydrates, and 2.4g of protein.A whole breadfruit, which weighs around 7 pounds, can provide the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five. Scientists believe its unique qualities could potentially feed the world, as it can produce 450 pounds of fruit per season. A team of researchers at Hawaii‚Äôs National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) are now working with the charity Alliance to End Hunger to distribute this fruit to countries that do not have a regular supply of food.   The low-fat, protein-rich, and carb-packed breadfruit is considered the new ""superfood"" that may solve world hunger one day.  Photo courtesy of Shutterstock  Diane Ragone, a horticulturalist and member of Hawaii‚Äôs National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG), who has been studying the plant since the 1980s, has traced back the roots of the fruit with the help of Nyree Zerega, director of the Graduate Program at Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic Garden. This research has helped scientists learn how they can distribute breadfruit to countries with high rates of poverty and hunger. ‚ÄúTraditionally in Polynesia you would plant a breadfruit when a child was born, because that would guarantee food throughout the child‚Äôs life‚Äù said Zerega, New Scientist reported.This high source of energy, fiber, and protein could help curb the leading cause of death in children in developing countries: malnutrition. The exotic fruit contains significantly high amounts of fiber, which can decrease bad cholesterol and triglycerides, known to increase heart attack risks. According to the American Heart Association, an increase in fiber intake lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in the body, while increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels. This helps to protect the body against heart disease and heart attacks.Experts are now investigating which varieties of breadfruit trees would be suitable for certain environments and climates, as well as local tastes for countries with a lack of food security. Moreover, they seek to identify which varieties of the fruit produce the best harvests and protein content. Josh Schneider a horticulturist and partner to the organization Global Breadfruit, previously told The Huffington Post Green: ‚ÄúEvery time we plant one of these trees, we‚Äôre reducing the susceptibility to famine and starvation in the country where the tree is going.""Currently, The Trees That Feed Foundation is planting more breadfruit trees in Haiti in hopes of feeding at least 1,000 orphans every day."

325,10323539,"This map shows 95,000 downloaders of child abuse pictures worldwide",http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/kampen-mot-overgrepsfiler/this-map-shows-95-000-downloaders-of-child-abuse-pictures-worldwide/a/23535650/,2015,"SMS: 2200 Tel: 22 000 000VG AS | Akersgata 55, PO Box 1185 Sentrum, 0107 OsloWORLD MAP: This map show people that according to VGs research have downloaded child abuse material. Click here to see interactive graphics.Thanks to an extensive data material VG knows of nearly 95,000 people worldwide who download photos and films showing child abuse. Most of them have probably paid to gain access to the material.Click here to see the interactive world map.Today VG presents the first part in a series of articles on people who download child abuse images. The Norwegian newspaper possesses information about 36 million downloads from all over the world. For ten months VG has mapped and identified Norwegians who have downloaded abuse material.ÔªøRead the entire story here: The DownloadersÔªøVG has detailed information on a large number of Norwegians who, according to our data, have spent time, money and resources on increasing the demand for child abuse images.We have, however, information on far, far more downloaders from all over the world.In total 430,177 files showing sexual abuse of children have been downloaded to 94,989 IP addresses the world over.REVEALED: VGs crew have revealed nearly 95.000 downloaders of child abuse material online. Here they are with Bj√∏rn-Erik Ludvigsen and Emil Kofoed at the National Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos).For every download, we have indications of the user name and email address of the downloader, in addition to information on the file and the IP address it was downloaded to.Even if an IP address is not the same as a person, there is reason to assume that VG has information on close to 95,000 people from all over the world, who spend time, money and resources on downloading child abuse images.The information is gathered from activities logged from a small number of file-sharing services which are preferred by people who share this kind of material.Einar Otto Stangvik, computer analyst in VG, believes that the map may indicate the location of several paedophile networks.¬†‚Äì The reason why one specific file-sharing service is used in one specific country may be that paedophiles and downloaders in this country discuss and recommend this service when they want to share abuse material. We have seen in several hidden forums that they recommend certain file-sharing services, and this discussion may happen not just on the Internet. One can therefore look at this world map as a representation of several geographic networks of downloaders and paedophiles, says Stangvik.‚Äì Another, more practical explanation may be that these countries simply have the best Internet connections, Stangvik continues.ANALYST: Einar Otto Stangvik, computer analyst in VG.Stangvik is the one who has uncovered the material. His analyses of the logs have revealed information on where abuse material is downloaded.He says that there may well be more people than those VG now know of, who have downloaded abuse material.¬†‚Äì These 95,000 IP addresses have downloaded the same files as the Norwegian downloaders seem to have done. It is not impossible that there is more abuse material in the data logs than what we have found so far, Stangvik says.The majority of the downloaders are in the large industrialized countries: Germany has the most downloaders in VG‚Äôs data material with 18,107 downloading IP addresses.Then follow the USA and Russia with 13,630 and 11,118 IP addresses respectively. The next countries on the list are Great Britain (3743 IP addresses), France (3393) and Japan (3336).VG has identified 78 Norwegians who seem to have downloaded abuse material.They are of all ages. The youngest downloader VG has identified is still in highschool. The oldest is well over sixty.They have all kinds of jobs. Some have top positions in the health services, others are unemployed and disabled. Some have done Christian work, others have held central positions in the armed forces. Some are manual workers; others are artists, musicians or photographers. Some work in IT.All the downloaders are men. That is one of the few common denominators.The only ones who have been able to validate VG‚Äôs material, are the downloaders themselves. We have therefore contacted and confronted ten of the men. Seven of them admit that our information corresponds to what they have actually done.‚Äì How on earth have you found out all this about me, is the reaction of the first person to be confronted by VG. He runs his own company.¬†‚Äì I don‚Äôt think I am doing something wrong. We all have different preferences. But if the police get hold of this, I go to jail, lose my house and my job. That would be the end of it.Several of the men VG confronts react by deleting all they have on their computer. One of the downloaders smashed his computer before he threw it in the ocean.¬†‚Äì I didn‚Äôt know whether to puke or shit myself. I was completely beside myself. But if you are looking for that kind of person, you have come to the wrong place. Sometimes, of course, you start to download something, and you don‚Äôt always realize what is being downloaded, is his explanation to VG why we have found information about him in the data material.Another insists that he has only downloaded out of curiosity.¬†‚Äì I thought it would be attractive. But every time I opened one of the films I had downloaded I only saw brutal abuse.Most of the men have been downloading for a long time, unbothered by the police. That corresponds to the image the National Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) have of the downloaders.¬†‚Äì Many of the people we catch in these cases are people who are completely unknown to the police. They are ordinary people from all professions, all social classes, all income groups, all ethnicities, all religions, says police Superintendent Bj√∏rn-Erik Ludvigsen at Kripos to VG.He has worked as investigator at the Section for Sexual Crime and is among those with the most knowledge of who the downloaders are.‚Äì There is no offender profile that fits those who have a sexual preference for children and crimes against children. They are all kinds of people. They are policemen, journalists, unemployed and everything else, he says.The investigator thinks that people who download child abuse material are also responsible for the crime against the children.¬†‚Äì Every instance of sharing or downloading abuse material contributes to maintaining the market for new instances of abuse against children. Without the downloaders there had not been as much child abuse. Furthermore, the images constitute a continuous violation of the children as long as the material stays on the Internet and is spread across the globe. They have to live with it for the rest of their lives, he says.Number of IP adressesfor each country that has downloaded child abuse images, according to the material VG have analyzed:18107 Germany13630 United States11118 Russia3743 United Kingdom3393 France3336 Japan2969 Brazil2364 Italy2073 Ukraine1899 Spain1837 Australia1777 Netherlands1723 Canada1672 Poland1589 Mexico1256 Sweden1178 Turkey1071 Argentina981 Belarus973 Austria885 Czech Republic851 Hungary750 Switzerland723 Peru649 Indonesia612 Saudi Arabia540 Finland502 Belgium446 Chile430 Norway422 Denmark410 Slovak Republic387 Uzbekistan361 Romania359 Iran350 Serbia333 Greece296 Israel294 India287 Kazakhstan286 Thailand283 South Africa280 Malaysia279 Colombia253 Portugal253 Algeria250 Taiwan250 New Zealand221 Ireland212 Bulgaria207 Philippines205 Egypt196 Republic of Korea180 Croatia153 Venezuela149 Isle of Man142 Republic of Lithuania134 Tunisia132 Hong Kong131 China125 Yemen123 Singapore117 Luxembourg113 Costa Rica111 Uruguay106 Latvia99 Estonia99 Sri Lanka98 Mauritius95 Bolivia93 Ecuador92 Pakistan83 Republic of Moldova81 Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan80 Paraguay71 Slovenia69 Guatemala67 Iraq63 MeetingPuerto Rico 6362 Azerbaijan56 Bosnia and Herzegovina55 United Arab Emirates53 Nicaragua52 Afghanistan50 Iceland49 Morocco47 Kuwait44 in Oman40 El Salvador39 Kyrgyzstan39 Trinidad and Tobago35 Syria33 Panama32 Palestine31 Lebanon31 Georgia20 Bahrain20 Dominican Republic18 Tajikistan18 Bangladesh16 Macedonia16 Honduras16 Cambodia16 Albania14 Senegal14 Armenia12 Nigeria12 Guadeloupe12 Cyprus11 Brunei10 Malta10 Guam10 Greenland10 BahamasHave an opinion on this matter?

When she told me about this it really shocked me and when she asked me, did I think that he was gay? All I could do is laugh out loud, I couldn't say for sure was he gay or not, but coming from a gay man. Most straight men don't even like you touching their behinds at all period, granted some may like to get fingered every now and again. To be real with you that to me is a little questionable.  Come on though for a totally straight man to want you to use a dildo on him to me isn't that far from him wanting the real thing. If he haven't tried the real thing already then experimenting with the dildo could most definitely spark his curiosity to want to try the real thing. He may not be gay yet, but in my opinion he definitely has gay tendencies.  I have this other female friend that runs to me all the time with her relationship issues, she's been with this guy going on two years. He never takes her anywhere, she hardly seems him. His excuse being having to work all the time, and the only time she ever really sees him is when he comes over for sex.  Yet, she is always arguing with this man and telling me about how stressed out she is. First of all if a man is really interested in you no matter what type of job he has or whatever else is going on in his life. If a man is really interested in you he is going to make time for you and not only when he wants sex.  She seemed to get rather pissed off at me when I pointed out that she wasn't he girl friend, but his jump off. I wasn't trying to hurt her feelings it was just the truth. If you don't hear from a man until he wants sex all that you are to that man is a piece of ass and that's it.  The thing that I can't understand about some women is why allow a man that's not doing anything for you, isn't paying none of your bills, and won't even take you out for a McDonald's cheeseburger stress you out?  Not to say you should just deal with anything from a man that's giving you something, but at least he is bringing something more to the table then just what's in his pants. If a man isn't giving you anything or adding anything to your life you shouldn't be stressing over him period. Stop falling in love with what's in a man's pants and putting up with anything just to get it. I know best that a no good man could put it down they have some of the best thing in the world, but sometimes you have to let that go and do what's best for you. Stop putting up with any and everything becausen the sex is good, I'm not downing nobody I use to be like that, but now I'm not and I'm so thankful.  The stupid things I use to do for guys just because they were cute, well endowed, and knew how to give good sex. I remember I use to give one guy half of my pay check everytime I got paid and I remember one night I wouldn't give him no money to get something that he wanted. Later that night I thought he was over it I had to pay bills and didn't have no extra money to give him. It was time for bed and I wanted sex so I eased over to him made my usual move of caressing my best friend. He pushed me off of him and turned over.  What? This man was staying in my house, eating off of me, and I was giving him money. I was practically taking care of him and he just because I couldn't give him what he wanted that night he blankly said forget me. I use to say its alright to be a fool as long as you know that you're bing a fool. Now I realize that that's not true it's worse when you're being a fool and know that you're being a fool, because you aware of it and still being a fool.  I think that some of my single girlfriends are just as crazy as the ones in relationships. If you meet a guy one Craigslist, Tango, or most of these other dating websites. Most of these men are just looking to hook up and they will feed you anything that they think you want to hear to get what they want. Stop feeding into that and giving these men what they want and then wondering why they don't call you the next day.  Really? A man will swear up and down that he wants to get to know you and have a real relationship with you, etc. to get into your pants. Whatever it takes to get what he wants and once you give it to him you can't take it back.  Women you have to have some self worth, because if you don't find yourself worthy of you, then these men certainly aren't. A man will treat you the way that you allow him too stop putting up with the mess then he'll stop bringing it to you.

327,8912114,This Is the Video CNN Will Play When the World Ends,http://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-video-cnn-will-play-when-the-world-ends-1677511538,2015,"
	Thirty-four years ago, at the launch of Ted Turner's Cable News Network, the founder made a grandiose and specific promise about his newly created round-the-clock operation. ""Barring satellite problems, we won't be signing off until the world ends,"" Turner declared. And in anticipation, he prepared a final video segment for the apocalypse:Advertisement
		We'll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event. We'll play the National Anthem only one time, on the first of June [the day CNN launched], and when the end of the world comes, we'll play 'Nearer My God To Thee' before we sign off.
	
	People thought he was joking. We have proof, acquired from a source, that he wasn't. Below is the never-before-seen video the last living CNN employee will be required to play before succumbing to radiation poisoning, the plague, zombies, or whatever crazy end Turner saw coming.
Yesterday the world got a premature look at the CNN apocalypse video, cable news&apos; very own‚Ä¶

				Read more Read more


	It lives on CNN's MIRA archive system, under the name TURNER DOOMSDAY VIDEO. Reflecting its status as an artifact, not to be used except in the ultimate emergency, it's in standard definition, with an aspect ratio of 4:3, perfect for the cathode-ray tube televisions of the 1980s.
	The video has already outlasted Ted Turner's ownership and the rise and fall of AOL. If it has not yet had the chance to serve as the capstone of all human experience, it nevertheless stands as a quiet monument to the globe-girdling ambitions behind CNN. Advertisement
	CNN may be the 
	human centipede of journalism at this point, its bloated corpse stumbling through the supposed middle ground of the wasteland that is American cable news, but it wasn't always that way. It was founded almost as an ideal, and much of the media world owes its very nature to the first cable news network.
	Before CNN, a regular person could absorb the news only in restricted doses, at specific times of day. Turner's innovation was in the idea of news without boundaries, night into day into night again, allowing anyone to be an obsessive media nut, every single second of every single minute of every day.Advertisement
	From 1980 on, news would always be there for you, right until the very end. At its birth, the now-moribund news giant operated like many of the new media organizations of today‚Äîhiring young people with little experience and plenty of drive, people who wanted the breathing space to explore every story that couldn't fit into a 30-minute news segment.
	Since those early years, CNN has grown into a ponderous object in the background, immovably entrenched on cable even as it has been tossed from corporate merger to corporate merger. Born as part of Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, in 1996 it became a part of Time Warner. In 2000 America Online bought Time Warner for $164 billion, and in 2006 Ted Turner himself left the Time Warner board. In 2009, the 
	biggest corporate mistake in history reached its inevitable conclusion, and AOL was spun off from the company it once attempted to dominate.
	Through it all there have been monumental culture shifts and budget re-adjustments, ideas tried out and tossed aside. There are few vestiges left of its original promise.Sponsored
	But there is still the video, awaiting its deployment. I was an intern at CNN back in 2009. Specifically, I worked at the 
	Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. Wolf was a nice enough guy, as people from Buffalo tend to be, but that's not really so weird. What was weird was seeing the apocalypse video.
	I was originally told about it by a college professor of mine, who had worked at CNN for over 20 years. It sounded mostly like a mythic joke, the kind of thing that Ted Turner, the all-around ""eccentric billionaire"" archetype, would mention offhand. Bison ranches, the America's Cup, four girlfriends at once, the last word on the last day on earth‚Äîwhy not?AdvertisementAdvertisement
	Turner's boast about broadcasting through the end of the world is the kind of thing you hear, in one form or another, from every startup founder.
	 My idea is the best, it will beat all the others, it is here to stay, forever and ever. No, we won't get bought by AOL. And Turner was known for being blustery.
	So when Ted Turner said that CNN was going to be playing ""Nearer My God To Thee""‚Äîthe song the band supposedly played when the Titanic went down‚Äîas the heavens opened up, as the fiery finger of God rained salt and brimstone from the sky, as the Earth beneath our feet opened from below and swallowed everything above, as the last CNN employee, in the last surviving CNN studio in the world, witnessed the end of existence before them, he meant it.
	Rumors of the doomsday tape's existence have popped up from time to time, as early as 1988, in the case of the 
	New Yorker, and as late as 2001, in the Daily News.Advertisement
	Few internal projects in media companies have that sort of staying power, but despite all the whiz-bang tech CNN likes to display on air, everything behind the scenes isn't so new.
	In contrast to CNN's ideas of what to put on television, all flashy smiles, enormous screens, and the occasional hologram, behind the scenes things can still be a little archaic.  I don't remember the exact day that I saw it, but it must've been a slow day in between all the regular intern duties of cueing up tapes and distributing mail. Maybe I should've been busier, but this was back in the 
	Situation Room's days of covering the 
	Balloon Boy saga, and so there weren't many obstacles in front of a bored college student looking to indulge his overcharged sense of curiosity.
	The video didn't take long to find; it turned up after a quick search in the database. There is no date attached, but the title reads ""TURNER DOOMSDAY VIDEO.""
	Should you find yourself watching the apocalypse live on CNN, the last thing you see will emphatically not be in 4K resolution.AdvertisementAdvertisement
	It's kept behind its own proverbial glass case. Angry, bold red letters are rendered on the computer screen of anyone who comes near it on CNN's intranet video database, reminding whoever accesses it that there is a grave restriction:
HFR till end of the world confirmed.

Hold for release. CNN, once ever so thorough in its factchecking, knew that the last employee alive couldn't be trusted to make a call as consequential as one from the Book of Revelation. The end of the world must be confirmed.
	That leaves open a whole host of unanswered questions. If this is the last CNN employee alive, in the last CNN bureau on Earth, who do they confirm it with? What does confirmation look like? Who can be the one to make that determination, to pronounce the universe itself dead? Is it Wolf Blitzer himself, ever a fan of the Washington Wizards, and thus a man who would know death when he saw it? Would it be Rick Davis, CNN's head of standards of practices, who has been with the company since its birth and who thus would know CNN's journalistic practices better than anyone?Advertisement
	Or would it be some sort of living embodiment of CNN itself, ready to proclaim its own demise, as Judgment Day is truly the only thing able to bring about the long-anticipated death of cable news?
	And who would be around to watch it?
	We don't know.AdvertisementAdvertisement
	All we have is this bleak yet romantic farewell, showcasing both the best and the worst of humanity with all of its unsettled questions. Like nuclear weapons or the little safety card they give you on the plane, it's the fact that we don't know why or how exactly we'd need it that stands as the most unsettling thing about the doomsday video. This may just be the last thing that whoever is left sees, watching on whatever device remains, when humanity's last remnant winks out of existence.
	So, in one small regard, this is actually the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends, not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with one melancholy little band, and a quick fade to black.
Note: Since this article has gone up, we've been getting a number of questions as to how we obtained the footage. While we can't go into specifics, it's not something we've been sitting on since I was an intern in 2009. While I've been aware of its existence since then, it was only acquired after I came onboard here at Jalopnik.Advertisement

But many entrepreneurs don‚Äôt realize that Angels are also extremely discerning in the projects that they will invest in, rejecting approximately 97% of the proposals submitted to them, according to the California Investment Network.Most of these investors are members of Angel groups that have a rigorous filtering and screening process, to select the top 3% and most fundable proposals. What is this daunting process, and what can you do to optimize your chances of surviving it? Over the past 10 years, I have had the opportunity to see how the process works, several times from the startup side, and more recently from the Angel perspective (as a member of an Angel group screening committee).Don‚Äôt expect the pomp and celebrity of the Angels on Shark Tank, but they do ask a lot of the right questions. So what should you do to prepare for this stage in your venture, and optimize your chances of making it through the process? Here is my list of top ten action items to best prepare you for success in achieving a funding event with Angels:In summary, being touched by an Angel can lead you to your dreams of a new and successful business, but it doesn‚Äôt happen without planning, hard work, and careful preparation. Most Angel investors are seeking psychic as well as financial benefit from their investment.

329,6574808,"Why I Will Never, Ever, Go Back to the United States",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/niels-gerson-lohman/us-border-crossing_b_4098130.html,2013,"After a year of traveling, I had planned a last, short trip. I was going to take the train from Montreal to New Orleans. The travels I had been undertaking earlier this year had brought me to places that were meant to form the background of my second novel.This trip, however, was for my dad. He, a trumpet player, loved New Orleans and had died a year ago. It felt like the first sensible trip I undertook this year. I had been searching for ways to forget about the last hours at his deathbed. He had been ill for 15 years and his body just would not give up. It was a violent sight. I had decided the trip to New Orleans would put an end to those memories.Usually, I barely plan my trips in advance. But this time I had booked everything: my train tickets, hotels and my flight back to Montreal, from which I would depart back to Amsterdam. In total the trip was supposed to take three weeks. The confirmations and tickets I had printed and tucked away in a brown envelope I had bought especially for the trip. I like things to be neatly arranged. At home, in Amsterdam, my house enjoys a slight version of OCD.The first part of the trip, from Montreal to New York, is known to be one of the world's prettiest train routes. When we had just passed the sign 'Welcome to the State of New York,' the train pulled over for a border check. I put the brown envelope on my lap. On top of the envelope I filled in my migration form with utmost dedication. I love border crossings. Forms don't lie.The customs officer walked by and asked everybody on the train a few questions. Where they were from, where they were heading. The usual stuff. Everybody who was not a U.S. or Canadian citizen was to head for the dining car to fill in an additional green form.In the dining car sat a cheerful looking family from the Middle East and a German man with a mouth in which a small frisbee could easily be inserted. I took the seat across the German, who had already filled in his green paper, and started on my own, dedicated, hoping to impress him. He was not throwing me friendly looks. The customs officer took the German's papers and welcomed him to America. They switched seats. He put his hands on the table and looked at me. We must have been of similar ages. He had a goatee and slid my passport towards him like it was a small gift.I had not finished my novel yet, but my passport was complete. It was filled with pretty stamps. He did not like the stamps.First, he saw my Sri Lankan stamp. The customs officer raised his eyebrows.    ""Sri Lanka, what were you doing over there?""    ""Surfing. Traveling. My best friend lives there. He is an architect.""The officer flipped on, seemingly satisfied. Secondly, he found my stamps from Singapore and Malaysia.    ""What were you doing over there? Singapore and Malaysia? Aren't those countries Islamic?""Looking over my shoulder, his eyes searched for his colleague's confirmation.    ""Malaysia, I think so, yeah. But not Singapore. It's a melting pot. A very futuristic city. Airconditioned to the ceiling. To Singapore I went mostly for the food, to be honest.""    ""Sure.""    ""I'm sorry?""    ""Nothing. And how about Malaysia?""I explained flights departing from Malaysia were cheaper compared to Singapore. That I only went there for a few days, but also, a little bit, for the food. The customs officer went through some more pages. Then he found my Yemeni visa. He put my passport down and stared at me.    ""What the hell were you doing in Yemen?""    ""I went to the island Socotra, it's not on mainland Yemen. It's a small island closer to Somalia. A very special place, some call it 'Galapagos of the Middle East.' I think 85 percent of the plants and animals there, are indigenous.""    ""Weren't you scared?""    ""Yeah. I was scared. When I was at the airport in mainland Yemen. That entire area is now taken by al Qaeda, I believe.""The customs officer was looking at my passport no longer. If he would have leafed through, he would have found Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi stamps.That was the first time I had to open my suitcase. Six customs officers went through my two phones, iPad, laptop and camera. In my wallet they found an SD card I had totally forgotten about. They did not like that. By now I was the only one left in the dining car and the center of attention. I had put a raincoat in my suitcase, because I'd heard New Orleans tends to get hit by thunderstorms in the late summer. An officer held up the coat and barked:    ""Who takes a coat to the U.S. in the summer?""I answered it would keep me dry, in case the New Orleans levees would break again. The officer remained silent. He dropped my coat like a dishcloth.The raincoat seemed to be the last straw. The customs officers exchanged looks.    ""We'd like to ask you some more questions. But the train has to continue, so we're going to take you off here.""I looked out of the window. We weren't at a proper station. Along the tracks were piles of old pallets.    ""Will you put me on another train, afterwards?""    ""This is the only train. But in case we decide to let you in, we'll put you on a bus. Don't worry.""I started to worry. I packed my suitcase as quickly as possible and was escorted off the train. There were three officers in front of me, and three behind. My suitcase was too wide for the aisle, it kept getting stuck between the seats. I apologized to the train in general. While I struggled, the officers waited patiently and studied the relation between me and my suitcase.Outside, we stopped in front of a white van. The officers permitted me to put my suitcase in the back and I was about climb into the van, when the they halted me.    ""You are not under arrest. There is no need to be scared. But we would like to search you.""    ""I'm not scared. But it's kind of exciting. It's like I'm in a movie. You're just doing your job. I get that.""To me, that seemed the right attitude. They searched me for the first time then, just like in the movies. Before I climbed into the van, I had to give up my phones. I seemed unable to close my belt by myself, so an officer helped me out. This is when the sweating started.In a little building made of corrugated tin, I opened my suitcase once more. Behind me, there was a man in tears. An officer was telling him about the prison sentence the man was looking forward to. He had been caught with a trunk full of cocaine. The man kept talking about a woman who seemed to be able to prove his innocence, but he was unable to reach her.After that they searched me again. Thoroughly.Just like in the movies.In the room next to me they tried to take my fingerprints, but my hands were too clammy. It took half an hour. An officer said:    ""He's scared.""Another officer confirmed:    ""Yeah. He's scared.""I repeated, another attempt to be disarming:    ""This is just like in the movies.""But border patrol is not easily disarmed.In the five hours that followed, I was questioned twice more. During the first round I told, amongst others, my life's story, about my second novel's plot, gave my publisher's name, my bank's name and my real estate agent's name. Together we went through all the photos on my laptop and messages my phones had been receiving for the past months. They wrote down the names of everybody I had been in touch with. In my pirated software and movies they showed no interest.During the second round of questioning, we talked about religion. I told them my mother was raised a Catholic, and that my dad had an atheist mother and a Jewish dad.    ""We don't understand. Why would a Jew go to Yemen?""    ""But... I'm not Jewish.""    ""Yeah, well. We just don't understand why would a Jew go to Yemen.""Again, I showed them the photos I took in Yemen and explained how nice the island's flora and fauna had been. That the dolphins come and hang out, even in the shallow water and how cheap the lobsters were. I showed them the Dragonblood trees and the Bedouin family where I had to eat goat intestines. They did not seem to appreciate it as much as I had.    ""You yourself, what do you believe in?""I thought about it for a second and replied.    ""Nothing, really.""Obviously, I should have said:    ""Freedom of speech.""When I'm supposed to watch my words, I tend to say the wrong ones.The last hour was spent on phone calls about me. Now and then an officer came and asked me for a password on my equipment. By then, the cocaine trafficker had been brought to a cell where they did have a toilet. I continued my wait. An officer, who I had not seen before, flung the door open and asked if I was on the Greyhound heading to New York. I shrugged hopefully. He closed the door again, as if he had entered the wrong room.Finally, two officers came rushing into my waiting room.    ""You can pack your bag. And make sure you have everything.""They gave me my phones back. All apps had been opened. I had not used my phones that day, but the batteries were completely drained. Because I was soaked in sweat, I attempted to change shirts while packing my bag. It seemed like I had made it.    ""How much time do we have? What time will the bus depart?""    ""We don't know.""I was unable to find the entrance to my clean shirt. I held it high with two hands, as if it was a white flag.    ""So... what's the verdict?""    ""We are under the impression you have more ties with more countries we are not on friendly terms with than your own. We decided to bring you back to the Canadian border.""They brought me back. In the car, no words were said. It was no use. I was defeated. To the Canadian border they said:    ""We got another one. This one is from the Netherlands.""The Canadian officer looked at me with pity. She asked if there was anything I needed. I said I could use some coffee and a cigarette. She took my passport to a back room and returned within five minutes, carrying an apologetic smile, a freshly stamped passport, coffee, a cigarette, and a ticket to the next bus back to Montreal.I have been cursed at a Chinese border. In Dubai, my passport was studied by three veiled women for over an hour and my suitcase completely dismembered. In the Philippines I had to bribe someone in order to get my visa extended for a few days. Borders, they can be tough, especially in countries known for corruption.But never, ever, will I return to the United States of America.

This is the future of programming. The vision of objects being different things in different contexts, while still keeping its identity is fantastic. Unfortunately, DCI is also the hardest one to use in day-to-day practice. Some of the concepts required (objects with roles) are hard to achieve in most popular languages.The most practical architecture is possibly DDD/CQRS. There is a lot of example projects in many different languages. I love the pragmatic approach of splitting the system into Commands and Queries. At first, I couldn't get the point, but after more reading I see the beauty of it. I sometimes laugh that DDD could stand for (data) Duplication-Driven Design. It opened my eyes to the idea, that we can have multiple subsystems, each with its own storage. Some data will be duplicated this way, but it's often not a problem. The data is eventually consistent.Another nice thing about DDD is the idea of Bounded Contexts. It's a terrible name, but a really useful concept of a module that encapsulates one little world of your project. Usually, you have one root object in each Bounded Context, which is called Aggregate. The same 'object' can exist in different BC, but will have a different name. Its identity will be kept via a unique id.CQRS brings the concept of Commands being the most complex parts of your app, while Queries are usually very simple and don't require many layers.What I like about the Clean Architecture is its focus on clear dependencies and on boundaries. Boundaries should be kept outside of your application. The communication between boundaries should happen via Data Transfer Objects. In the middle there's the Interactor, which represent a UseCase.Last, but not least, we've got the Hexagonal Architecture. This is what inspired us mostly to create the JavaScript non-framework called¬†http://hexagonaljs.com/. It's so easy to extract GuiAdapter and StorageAdapter, leaving the middle hex boundary-unaware.HexagonalJS is a result of inspiration from all of the above architectures. We took the UseCase/Context part from the DCI architecture with a little bit of the Clean Architecture. The idea of adapters is taken from the Hexagonal Architecture. The middle hex is often implemented using the building blocks taken from DDD. Our unique addition to this setup is a little bit of Aspect Oriented Programming.Often, when I'm in doubt how to approach a new project, I'm trying to stand far from the Upfront Design. However, it doesn't hurt if I imagine the project in each of the architectures. This gives me new ideas about the domain I'm implementing.Discover the warning signs of DevOps Dysfunction¬†and learn how to get back on the right track, brought to you in partnership with¬†CA Technologies.Free DZone Refcard

335,7520269,Yet Another Source Predicting the Death of Email,http://www.josic.com/yet-another332-source-predicting-the-death-of-email,2014,"The majority of online marketers still rely primarily on email marketing to reach their target audience. Email is still the primary marketing tool used across the board. Yet despite the overall success of email and the continued widespread use of email, there are regular predictions on the death of email.This time the predictions are coming from Bloomberg Businessweek. They give three reasons why email is dead. Here are their reasons:While there may be some validity to these arguments, they hardly spell the death of email. Additionally, despite these assertions, email marketing is still going strong. Email inboxes have been overloaded with messages for years, and social media isn‚Äôt new either. If these factors were killing email marketing, there would be at least some sign of a slow down. Not only is email marketing not slowing down, it is still the strongest marketing tool available.Email is the basis of everyone‚Äôs online identity. We need an email address to do online banking, create social media accounts, and set up our phones, cable, internet and more. While not everyone regularly checks their email, everyone who operates in minimally online requires an email address that they can receive messages at.Email will never go away. While marketers may find a more effective way to sell to their intended audience, it will simple be a shift in activity. Additionally, there are no shifts in the works that have the potential to take over email marketing. Social media and other platforms for marketing do not offer the same conversion rates as email.Melanie graduated in 2004 from Bowling Green State University.

Among leisure travelers, the site with the highest recommendation is TripAdvisor at 81%, followed by Kayak (74%) and TravelZoo (72%).The audit tested 30 of the most popular sites in the online travel space including AOLTravel, Booking.com,¬†bookit.com, Expedia, Hotwire, Kayak, Orbitz, TravelZoo, Trivago, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor, Smarter Travel, etc. Additional findings include:Among online travel agency users, 76% of leisure and business travelers consider travel websites as their ‚Äúgo to‚Äù for booking hotels, compared to only 24% who use specific hotel websites.¬†Some of the top hotel booking sites include Hotels.com (18%), Expedia (15%) and Priceline (10%).Business travelers are more likely than their leisure traveler counterparts, to use travel websites for airline planning and booking. However, the top airline planning sites for both groups are Expedia (19% / 18%), Kayak (11% / 10%), Travelocity (10% / 9%), Priceline (9% / 8%), and Orbitz (6% / 6%).The three most important characteristics to consider for both business and leisure travelers when choosing a travel site are ‚Äúease of use‚Äù, ‚Äúlower prices than booking directly with individual travel providers‚Äù, and ‚Äúprice guarantee‚Äù.‚ÄúOur Online Travel Audit is about more than just examining the basic competitors,‚Äù said John Antonello, Managing Director of Phoenix Travel and Leisure. ‚ÄúWe look at the travel industry in its entirety, along with consumer sentiments around brands and advertising. ¬†This gives us more of a holistic approach to getting all-inclusive data and the ability to deliver actionable insights for brand and marketing professionals in the online travel industry.‚ÄùIn the coming weeks additional findings will be released including details on the top ads in the Airline, Car Rental, Hotel categories.

Mt Gox recently went out of business and has yet to account for 850,000 bitcoins valued at around $450 million, which the company originally claimed was stolen by hackers.The Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan shortly after suspending trading in February.¬†The court ruling came about after a Mt Gox user, Gregory Green, filed a lawsuit in Chicago against Mt Gox, stating that he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoins. ¬†Green is being represented by Chris Dore from Edelson PC in Chicago, who stated:‚ÄúMoney is moving around as we speak, bitcoins are moving around accounts associated with Mt.

338,7360708,Drones are the Future of Journalism,http://www.josic.com/drones-are332-the-future-of-journalism,2014,"Drones, helicams, hexacopters, octocopters and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) all have something in common; they can all be used to capture video footage in areas and situations that are not conducive to sending in live reporters.Drones have already been used to capture footage of the floods in Worcester, as well as protests in Kiev and Bangkok. While there will always be a place for on-the-scene journalist and SkyCopter reports, drones certainly open up a new opportunity for major news sources. They have more capabilities, they are safer than sending reporters into dangerous situations, and they are more cost effective then SkyCopters. Many are hailing drones as the future of journalism.Drones have been used for years by the military, hobbyist and photographers. They have been used to assess dangerous situations, as well as capture breathtaking aerial views of landscape. It is only recently that major news sources have started realizing the true potential of drones. According to Robert Picard, co-author of a report covering the topic, ‚ÄúThings are moving, and I suspect photo departments and broadcast news production will be using them more often this year. Most of the big broadcasters are already test using them and some print photographers are learning how to use smaller systems.‚ÄùIn October 2013, BBC started using a hexacopter. According to Thomas Hannen, the senior innovations producer in the global video unit of the BBC, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an exciting new way to tell stories, taking us from a human level to a birds-eye overview.‚Äù He went on to say, ‚ÄúAlthough it may not revolutionize news, it is certainly another tool in the journalist toolkit, particularly useful for stories, for transport or with environmental and geographical element to them. But, we don‚Äôt see them as a replacement for a news helicopter.‚ÄùOther news sources that have explored the use of drones are Sky News and Russia Today. While many are excited by the new prospect, there are still challenges to overcome. One of these challenges is the legality of using drones. Many countries have or are putting restrictions on where drones are allowed to fly, mostly for safety and privacy issues.JOSIC MEDIA is a leading provider of News, Data & Insights on Digital Media Trends and Innovations.Your email address will not be published.

339,9878910,Did Reddit's Former CEO Just Reveal a ‚ÄúLong Con‚Äù to Sabotage the Site?,http://gawker.com/did-reddits-former-ceo-just-reveal-a-long-con-plan-to-1717334704,2015,"After Reddit‚Äôs surrender to white supremacy this week, users and observers alike have been trying to figure out how exactly we got to this nadir. How could something so popular get so much wrong, over and over again? A new post by Reddit‚Äôs ex-chief suggests it‚Äôs all been an inside job.Yesterday, Ellen Pao stepped down as CEO of Reddit. Co-founder Steve Huffman will take her place.‚Ä¶When Yishan Wong chimed in on a thread called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best ‚Äòlong con‚Äô you ever pulled?‚Äù Here‚Äôs one.In 2006, reddit was sold to Conde Nast. It was soon obvious to many that the sale had been premature, the site was unmanaged and under-resourced under the old-media giant who simply didn‚Äôt understand it and could never realize its full potential, so the founders and their allies in Y-Combinator (where reddit had been born) hatched an audacious plan to re-extract reddit from the clutches of the 100-year-old media conglomerate.Together with Sam Altman, they recruited a young up-and-coming technology manager with social media credentials. Alexis, who was on the interview panel for the new reddit CEO, would reject all other candidates except this one. The manager was to insist as a condition of taking the job that Conde Nast would have to give up significant ownership of the company, first to employees by justifying the need for equity to be able to hire top talent, bringing in Silicon Valley insiders to help run the company. After continuing to grow the company, he would then further dilute Conde Nast‚Äôs ownership by raising money from a syndicate of Silicon Valley investors led by Sam Altman, now the President of Y-Combinator itself, who in the process would take a seat on the board.Once this was done, he and his team would manufacture a series of otherwise-improbable leadership crises, forcing the new board to scramble to find a new CEO, allowing Altman to use his position on the board to advocate for the re-introduction of the old founders, installing them on the board and as CEO, thus returning the company to their control and relegating Conde Nast to a position as minority shareholder.JUST KIDDING. There‚Äôs no way that could happen.In other words, Wong is saying Reddit‚Äôs ongoing leadership crisis (and the public sacking of Pao) has been a deliberate attempt to put its original team back into power and subvert Conde Nast. Wong is almost certainly joking, at least in part. Maybe he‚Äôs just looking for some levity during a particularly dark period for the site. But it‚Äôs an odd joke and a suspiciously believable conspiracy to spin, given that it‚Äôs basically come true: Wong and Pao were indeed deposed, while Reddit‚Äôs originators, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, are firmly back in power, just as they were in 2005 while they created Reddit in a UVA dormitory.The mods who rocked Reddit on its most chaotic day have spoken out in a New York Times op-ed in an‚Ä¶Wong also has an ax to grind. He ran Reddit from 2012 to 2013 and waded through his share of community conflict: Gawker‚Äôs Violentacrez expos√©That didn‚Äôt stop Reddit‚Äôs current power structure from responding to his big reveal:From Steve Huffman, Pao‚Äôs replacement as CEO, and co-founder: ‚ÄúWe all had our roles to play.‚ÄùFrom Sam Altman, Y-Combinator chief and Reddit board member:Cool story bro.Except I could never have predicted the part where you resigned on the spot :)Other than that, child‚Äôs play for me.Thanks for the help. I mean, thanks for your service as CEO.Even Ellen Pao herself remarked: ‚ÄúHow is this funny? /s‚ÄùAgain, it‚Äôs worth assuming Wong is being mostly facetious. But maybe he‚Äôs not‚Äîit wouldn‚Äôt be the first time he‚Äôs been uncomfortably bluntContact the author at biddle@gawker.com"

  On the outside, this giant fruit resembles something out of the
  Jurassic era and emits a¬†sweet yet putrid stench.

  But don't be fooled: The fruit, known as a jackfruit, is being
  hailed as a ""miracle"" crop that could save millions from
  starvation. And the unique fruit inside of it is just the
  beginning of the jackfruit's many wonders.

  Jackfruit is the largest tree-borne fruit in the world ‚Äî one
  fruit can weigh between 10 and¬†100 pounds and contain
  hundreds
  of seeds that are rich in protein, potassium, calcium, and
  iron ‚Äî all of which are important for bodily growth.

  This enigmatic fruit is native to South and Southeast Asia; it is
  rare to find jackfruit in the US. Luckily, Chinatown in Manhattan
  sells whole, fresh jackfruit.

  To get a first-hand look at this leathery, prickly food, Business
  Insider trekked from the Flatiron district to Chinatown where we
  spotted a jackfruit being offered by one of the many street
  vendors. The vendor was selling it for $2.50 per pound.

  It is common to purchase freshly sliced jackfruit by the pound,
  but we were on a mission to learn everything we could about this
  monster fruit, so we bought the whole, uncut 10 pounds of it.

  Here's more about the strange but beneficial fruit.
Amy scissors on Flickr
  Nyree Zerega is a plant biologist at the Chicago Botanic Garden
  who has studied the genetic diversity of jackfruit tress in
  Bangladesh.

  ""In Bangladesh, where jackfruit is the national fruit, it is
  often considered the second-most important crop after mangos,""
  Zerega told Business Insider.

  ""And if you have space to grow something, you almost always have
  a jackfruit tree ‚Äî due to both its valuable fruits and timber.""

  Besides food, the jackfruit tree provides some of the following:

  As popular as jackfruit is in Bangladesh, it is avoided in India,
  where it is thought to have originated and where it could bring
  copious amounts of food to 
  millions of people who are starving and malnourished. That's
  why the jackfruit tree ‚Äî which can grow up to 150 jackfruits over
  the two harvest seasons it typically has each year ‚Äî is so
  important.

  A single jackfruit can yield hundreds of the small, yellow, fruit
  lobes (or bulbs) ‚Äî each of which contain a highly nutritious
  seed. The fruit itself is a good source of Vitamin C, while the
  seeds are rich in protein, potassium, calcium, and iron. About
  one-fifth of a pound of the fruit has approximately 95 calories.

  ""It's a miracle. It can provide so many nutrients and calories ‚Äì
  everything,"" Shyamala Reddy, who is a biotechnology researcher at
  the University of Agriculture Sciences in Bangalore, India, told
  
  The Guardian earlier this year.

  ""If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don't need
  food for another half a day.""

  A single fruit could feed your family for an entire meal, Zerega
  told Business Insider. That's partly due to its size, but also
  because of the many different ways that people have learned to
  prepare the jackfruit. It can either be eaten ripe, when it is
  soft, fruity, and delicious, or unripe, when it resembles a
  potato.

  In Bangladesh and other parts of Southeast Asia, jackfruit is
  served in dozens of ways. Jackfruit curry, stir fry, juice,
  chips, ice cream, and even baking flour ‚Äî made from drying and
  grinding the seeds or fruit ‚Äî are just a few examples of
  jackfruit‚Äôs remarkable versatility in the kitchen.

  However, jackfruit does not keep for more than a few weeks after
  harvest, Zerega said, so a good way to preserve it (if you're not
  going to make a jackfruit feast like the one in the photo below)
  is to store it in cans or dry it out into chips.

  Here‚Äôs a table displaying over a dozen different styles of
  jackfruit preparation:
Shree Padre for Dike Strike
  Though jackfruit is still widely unknown in the US, it is
  cropping up in the vegan and vegetarian communities because of
  the flavor that unripened jackfruit adopts after an hour or so of
  cooking, which resembles that of pulled pork.

  Zerega hasn‚Äôt tried the increasingly popular BBQ jackfruit
  sandwich, but some of us at Business Insider did, and you can see
  our assessment in the video below!

  While millions of households in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia,
  and elsewhere across South and Southeast Asia are incorporating
  the jackfruit into their dishes, India remains reluctant.

  Reportedly, up to 75% of jackfruit grown in India goes to waste,
  partly because the fruit goes bad if it's not eaten or preserved
  within a few weeks.

  But more than that, jackfruit has a bad reputation to overcome.

  ""Historically, jackfruit has a reputation for being a poor man's
  fruit,"" Zerega said. ""It's not the kind of thing that many people
  would ever think of buying because it grows everywhere in certain
  parts of India.""

  Fortunately for the fruit, it has a growing number of fans
  advocating for it, trying to raise awareness for its nutritional
  value.

  ""My country is silently allowing [the] lion‚Äôs share of our
  jackfruits to rot,"" Shree Padre, who lives in the Indian state of
  Kerala, told Business Insider in an email. ""This disturbed me.""

  Padre is the editor of a 27-year-old Indian magazine called
  ""Adike Patrike,"" and
  over the last six years he has orchestrated 16 issues dedicated
  to the jackfruit. Padre also helps organize jackfruit festivals
  in India.

  ""Countries like Vietnam, Philippines, and Malaysia are minting
  money from jackfruit. Sri Lanka proudly calls it [the] 'tree of
  rice,'"" Padre said. ""But ironically, in [the] motherland of
  jackfruit, we still haven‚Äôt understood jackfruit's importance.""

  Because of its versatility, Padre estimates that farmers in India
  could earn about $151 per jackfruit tree because of all the
  different products you can make with its bark, fruit, natural
  latex, and more.
World title pay on Flickr
  ""It has five raw materials in one,"" he said. ""No other crop of
  the world will come near to the number of products and recipes
  that can be made from jackfruit.""

  One jackfruit tree could bring in more than half the average
  monthly income for an Indian worker, which is $295, according to
  the 
  International Labor Organization. (The average American
  monthly income is $3,236.)

  What‚Äôs more, jackfruit trees are generally easier and cheaper to
  cultivate than other popular staples like wheat and corn because
  they don't have to be replanted every year, Zerega said.

  ""As long as it's growing in a climate that is conducive to its
  survival ... jackfruit is relatively easy to maintain,"" she told
  Business Insider.

  Popovkin on Flickr



  However, for India, making a business out of selling jackfruit
  like the Vietnamese have done will be difficult, at first, which
  is why Indian locals should first focus on eating the fruit

  Zerega says that harvesting and processing jackfruit is currently
  very laborious with little mechanization, and while farming and
  exporting jackfruit could grow to be a lucrative business for
  India in the future, it is also important to focus on it as a
  valuable food source within the country.

  ""A lot of underutilized crops like jackfruit have a ton of
  potential to produce food more locally and more sustainable, so
  there's not as much reliance on imports from other countries.
  This local market development is important to focus on,"" Zerega
  said. ""But ultimately they can also provide countless
  opportunities as valuable export products.""

350,9782586,101 simple ways to know the gender of your baby,http://www.chinesegenderchart.info/pregnancy-chart-gender-selection/101-at-home-baby-gender-prediction-tests/,2015,"If you are looking for simple, interesting and non-clinical ways to determine if you are having a baby boy or a baby girl, then you‚Äôll love this article. Here is a list of one hundred and one at-home gender predictors that most of them you‚Äôve probably never heard of.¬†¬†¬†¬†Baby gender prediction by 1. Shape : When the face gets narrower and longer you are said to be carrying a boy; when the shape takes on a fuller and rounder form you are said to be carrying a girl.2. Skin¬†: Acne are more prevalent when the mother to be is carrying a girl; if the skin stays clear and free from spots then she is carrying a boy.3. Hair #1 : The hair of an expectant mother that is carrying a girl will often seen to be duller and thinner than before she became pregnant; when the hair becomes more glossy and full of body then she is having a boy. It should also be a girl if reddish highlights are found in the hair during pregnancy.4. Hair #2 : Pull a pregnant woman‚Äôs hairs up from the back of her neck. If you find new hair growth that forms in ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape, she is having a boy. If new hairs are growing straight across the neck, she is having a baby girl.5. Nose : When pregnant, the expectant mother can also expect to notice changes in the size and shape of her nose when she is carrying a boy. These changes where the nostrils will get bigger and wider are only temporary and the nose will return to its former shape once her infant son is born.6. Eye Vein : By studying the white part of the eye under the iris you can also predict the sex of your unborn child. If there is the presence of a vein, either ‚ÄúV‚Äù, ‚ÄúY‚Äù, or ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped under the left eye then you are said to be carrying a girl; when this vein is present under the right eye it is said that you are carrying a boy. When there are veins present in both eyes then the sex of the unborn child is female; no veins at all mean that you are carrying a boy.7. Overall Beauty : For the pregnant women, if you feel yourself or your friends tell you that you look prettier than before, you are probably carrying a son. If unfortunately your beauty disappears when you are pregnant, you are more likely having a daughter.Interestingly, the Chinese think the opposite which means that a girl in the womb brings pregnant woman more beauty. 8. Breast Size #1 : The breasts of women who are carrying girls will grow faster and gain bigger size than those of women who are carrying boys.At her book ‚ÄúDo Chocolate Lovers Have Sweeter Babies?‚Äú, science journalist Jena Pinecott says that women carrying male babies have their breasts increase an average of 8cm (3.2 inches) compared with 6.3cm (2.5 inches) for women carrying boys.In Poland, a¬†study of 120 women carried by Galbarczyk A. of Jagiellonian University Medical College, reveals thatChanges in breast circumference during pregnancy were associated with the infant‚Äôs gender. Surprisingly, mothers of female infants had greater breast circumference changes than the mothers of male infants. 9. Breast Size #2 : ¬†If the right breast is larger than the left one, then it is a boy. If the left bust is bigger, it is a girl.Hippocrates of Cos (460~357 B.C.), who is referred to as the father of western medicine, described ‚Äúif the fetus were a boy, the right eye of the mother would be brighter and clearer and her right breast would be larger and of a particular shape‚Äù.10. Belly Shape : The sex of the unborn child can also be predicted by studying the shape of the belly. When the belly expands to the sides and towards the hips like a watermelon, you are said to be carrying a girl; when the belly is basketball shaped and is all out the front then you will give birth to a son. 11. Belly Softness :¬†If the belly of the pregnant female remains soft then she is carrying a girl; when the belly is tense and hard she will give birth to a son.12. Position of Carrying : The sex of an unborn child can be determined by looking at how his/her mother¬†is carrying him/her¬†in the womb. When the baby is positioned high up the mother-to-be is¬†carrying a girl; when the mother-to-be is¬†carrying low she will give birth to a son.13. Legs : If an expectant mother is suffering from swelling in the legs at the earlier stages of pregnancy then it is said that she is having a girl; if her legs don‚Äôt swell at all or swelling only occurs in later stage of pregnancy then she will give birth to a baby boy.14. Leg Hair : If you notice acceleration in the growth of hair on your legs then it is said that you are carrying a boy. 15. Hands : The sex of the unborn child can also be predicted by looking at the hands of the expectant mother. When she skin stays soft and supple she is carrying a girl; when the skin becomes hard and cracked she is having a boy.16. Nail :¬†Nails grow faster and stronger, it is a boy.17. Belly button : If the navel starts to protrude when you are pregnant then your unborn child is male; if your belly button stays the same then you are carrying a girl. 18. Stretch Marks : Stretch marks come with the territory of being pregnant, most especially in the tummy. However, you can determine the sex of your unborn child by looking carefully at these marks; more marks on the left hand side of the tummy mean that you are carrying a boy; if there are more stretch marks on the right hand side then you are carrying a girl.19. Linea Nigra : The dark line that runs up from the pubic bone to the navel during pregnancy is called linea nigra. When this line goes far past the navel and reaches the rib cage, the baby is a boy; when the line stops at the belly button, it is a baby girl.OR If there is another line above the navel, and the two lines meet at the navel, it is a boy. If the two lines do not meet, it is a girl. ¬†20. Entire Body : ¬†If from behind the expectant mother¬†doesn‚Äôt seem to be pregnant then it‚Äôs a boy, but if she looks pregnant from all sides, then it‚Äôs a baby girl.21. Vaginal Discharge : If you are seeing the passing of whitish liquid (in small quantities) during your pregnancy from vagina, you would have a baby boy. If you are passing through small dots of blood occasionally during your pregnancy, it is believed to be a baby girl."

353,7356426,Using Git with Visual studio,http://bezensek.com/blog/2014/03/06/using-git-with-visual-studio/,2014,"Source code needs to be under version control, period. When it comes to deciding which system to use, Git is one of the options. There are many heated debates which one is the best, but let‚Äôs not go into that. All of them do their job, so it mostly comes down to personal preference. I like Git.
In January 2013 the Visual Studio team announced that Visual Studio will have Git support and you can download it from here if you want. You will need Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 at least.I have tried the extension but I don‚Äôt recommend it just yet. It is still lacking many features and it seems very rushed. In a few iterations it might be worth to install it but for now I would say stay away. This is why I decided to discuss possible alternatives, namely: command line, Git Extensions and Source Tree.So how can you start using Git? The easiest way in terms of required software is the command line. First of all you need to download and install Git. After that you just need to read the documenation and you can immediately start using it from the command line.And that is a good way to start using it if you are not familiar with it. Since you have to type in all the commands you will think twice if this is the right thing to do. And you won‚Äôt get overwhelmed by all the possible commands. You will learn one or two commands and really get to know those. For starters you just need init and commit. Soon after that you will want to save the source code on another computer, not only on your own. That‚Äôs when remotes, push and pull come into play. And when you start to work in a team, sharing the code, you will need to learn about branches and maybe even about branching models like GitFlow for example.Does this work with Visual Studio. Absolutely. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt understand why so much fuss about Git being incorporated into Visual Studio. Many developers only use git from the command line. Some would even argue that that‚Äôs the only way to use it. I understand that commiting directly from the IDE is probably faster and that visual representation of the branch tree is nice. However, writing a few additional lines every day sholdn‚Äôt keep you from using Git!The next option is a Visual Studio extension called Git Extensions. It‚Äôs the only one of the three alternatives that I mention that is completely integrated into Visual Studio. After installing you get an additional toolbar in your workspace:The most used commands are directly exposed on the toolbar, but you can open up a window where all git commands are only a click away. You can also see your branch tree and commit messages.If you like the integrated way you might also want to check Git Source Control Provider which allows you to see the status of your files in the solution explorer. It makes it easy to see which files were newly added, which were changed,‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had some minor problems with Git Extensions. Sometimes the window crashed if I had it opened for too long. I also ran into some authentication problems when pushing to Bitbucket. This problem was solved by manually running their git-credentials-windstore executable. Apart from that I quite liked it. It is really rich with options and possibilities and also works remarkably well.The last option is a standalone desktop application called Source Tree from Atlassian. While the Mac version has been around for quite some while they have released the Windows version not so long ago.I must admit that lately I‚Äôve been using Source tree the most. I really like the nice user interface, it is also very easy to keep track of multiple projects. And there is another little gem: it has support for Gitflow. So you can easily start new features, hotfixes, releases.So until the Visual Studio team improves their extension I think any of the three proposed options is better. Once again it will come down to personal preference. Do you want visual control or do you like command line? Do you want to have integration with Visual Studio or is a standalone application also ok?Keep up with the updates:  Follow @MitjaBezensek

355,7289752,Introduction to HTML5 Desktop Apps With Node-Webkit,http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-html5-desktop-apps-with-node-webkit--net-36296,2014,"Using Node.js, we can create web applications easily. Now, thanks to the node-webkit we can also create desktop apps with it, using a unique combination of HTML5 and Node.The library combines WebKit engine and Node.js in a unique way. Both WebKit and Node share the same context, allowing you to write your code like it's meant to be executed in a browser, but with the addition of all Node's features.The list of uses is endless. You can create business apps, text and image editors, games, presentations, admin panels, etc. Just name the desktop app that you would like to create, and I can assure you that it will be possible with node-webkit.In this tutorial, I will show you how to get started by showing you how to create a simple text editor.First, you have to get the library. Download the version appropriate for your operating system (the application itself will run on all of them) from github and unzip it wherever you'd like. Now, lets create a basic folder structure. We will have folders for HTML files (.html) and for JavaScript files (.js). Also, create the package.json file in the same directory that the nw executable is in and a node_modules folder to keep the modules we will create.The first thing to do is to fill the required fields in the package.json file. In the case of node-webkit these are name and main (on Github you can find the full list of available package.json options). The first one is exactly the same as in the case of a plain Node.js app. The second one should be a (relative or absolute) path to the main HTML file that will be displayed upon the application starting. In the case of our example, the package.json file should look like this:Now if you run your app using the nw executable, you should see a blank screen like this:Creating the user interface using node-webkit is no different than creating a webpage (with the slight difference that you know the rendering engine, so you don't have to provide any fallbacks for older browsers, or use libraries like jQuery - and actually you shouldn't, because they include fallback code that will slow down your app). Let's create an index.html file that we will use:Let's also include (and create) the main JavaScript file that we will use, in the body, so it will be executed after the DOM is loaded:Now the only thing that will change when you open the app will be the title.To show you how easily you can use Node.js in node-webkit, let's read the contents of package.json and print it on the screen. Create the js/main.js file and put the following code in it:As you can see, the code looks exactly the same as if you were writing it for Node. But then we use document.write to put the file contents on the page. No need to setup any local server.Now open the app and you should see something like this:There is another nice thing about node-webkit; You don't have to include a series of <script> tags in your HTML if you want to split your code into modules. You can do it just like you do in Node.js - using require. Let's create a simple module to read file contents to a textarea or write it to a file. Name the file file.js and put it in the node_modules directory. Now put the overall module structure in it:As you can see this will be a static class with two public methods - one for opening the files and one for saving them.The open method will look like this:Pretty simple right? The function accepts the path to the file as the first parameter and puts the file's contents into the element with an id of ""editor"". We also need to pass the document object to the function because the script is called using Node's require and it doesn't have access to the WebKit stuff directly.The save method is as simple as the previous one:Now let's test if everything works. Change the contents of js/main.js to this:Now if you go to the developer tools console and click the developer refresh button in the right corner of the window you should see the two functions from this module logged. This is another useful thing in node-webkit - your console.log calls are being displayed in the developer tools console, so it's easier to debug your apps.Let's add two file inputs that we will need later:Notice the nwsaveas attribute in the second input. It is a special type of input from node-webkit, that allows the user to select a non-existing file. Both of the inputs are hidden, because we will only access them from JavaScript. In node-webkit, file inputs are modified in a way that allows you to fire a click event on them, so you can open the file dialog without the user clicking on the input (with no need for the workarounds like invisible inputs above the button). Now we can move to the JavaScript.First, remove the console.log call from the js/main.js file. Now put this code in there:This code is responsible for showing the Open and Save dialogs. The clickInput function does the main job here - it simulates the click event on the input element - in a normal browser, this would be impossible from security reasons, but here it's not a security threat at all. Later, there is a normal keyup event handler that checks if the proper key combination was pressed (Ctrl+O or Ctrl+S) and ""clicks"" on the inputs. Note that this would also be impossible to achieve in a browser - combinations like Ctrl+O and Ctrl+S are reserved for the browser's internal use and no event fires when they are pressed (only Firefox fires events for them).Now press the developer refresh button and you should see the appropriate dialog when you press Ctrl+S or Ctrl+O. They of course do nothing for now.Now, since we will be creating a text editor, we need something to write on. Add the textarea to the HTML:Next we have to finish the opening/saving code. Let's create the onchange event listeners for the open and save inputs:Thanks to the module created earlier, the code is really simple. This is also possible thanks to node-webkit, because in browsers (again for security reasons) the value of the file input element is set to a fake path - here it's the path which was selected. Now open the app (or press the developer refresh button, if you didn't closed it) and you should have a perfectly working text editor.We can also do a few other things to make the editor a bit more advanced and useful. For example, let's open a new window when a user presses Ctrl+N. First, add this require to the top of the script:The nw.gui module is a node-webkit's library related to the user interface (you can read more about this on Node-webkit's Github). Next add this else if to the document's keyup listener:And viola! If you refresh the app, now you can press Ctrl+N to open a new window. This function does differ from the normal window.open though. You can pass various window options as the second parameter. The list of what you can set there is available in the documentation.Another thing that may be useful in a text editor is an application menu (the one that sits under the title bar in Windows/Linux and on the top of the screen on Mac). In node-webkit it's pretty simple. First, let's create the menu:The type menubar is reserved for the application menu. Now we can add items to it. Let it be a File menu:Now let's add some items to this menu:menu.items[0] is the first item of our application menu (you can also assign it to a variable when creating it if you want to). We are appending new items to its submenu, and each item gets a click callback to handle the click on it. The gui.Window.get method gets the current window, so we can close it when the user selects the Close option in the File menu.Finally, we can assign the menu to the window:Again, we are using gui.Window.get to get the current window, then we are assigning our menu to its menu property. Please note, that even though we can assign a different menu to every window, on OSX (Mac) one app can only have one menu (which is global for all windows), so if you want your app to be used on Macs, you should avoid using different menus on different windows.Now if you open or refresh your app, you should see a system menu under the titlebar:Now if you would like to share your app with other users, you can package it into one file, so the users can download the node-webkit's executable appropriate to their platform and launch your app with it. First, let's remove the toolbar that makes the window look like a browser - it's nice to have during development, but your users probably don't want to see it. We can achieve this by setting window.toolbar to false in package.json, so it looks like this:Now if you open the app (nothing will change if you just refresh it, package.json is loaded only on startup), you should see the final result:Packaging the app is pretty simple. Just create a .zip archive with all your assets (all of the files you created, without the files supplied with node-webkit) and change its extension to .nw. That's all. If a user downloads node-webkit and your package, they only need to put it in the node-webkit's directory and run the nw executable. Detailed descriptions, with a few more tips, are available on the node-webkit's github.Now your editor is ready to be shipped to your users.As you can see, node-webkit is a very promising and powerful library. With frequent updates and fixes, and being supported by Intel, there's almost no chance that it will be discontinued, which can sometimes happen with open source projects.Share your thoughts about this project in the comments below. I personally think it's the best thing out there if you want to create a desktop application using Node.js and HTML.Also have a look at the selection of useful¬†Node.js¬†and HTML5 scripts and apps on Envato Market.Envato Tuts+ tutorials are translated into other languages by our community members‚Äîyou can be involved too!"

357,7996322,Is Startup Validation Bull?,http://wpcurve.com/is-startup-validation-bullshit/,2014,"Shortly before starting my software app Informly I read the Lean Startup and had lots of conversations with some very smart software entrepreneurs about validation. I also read lots of posts from people who had ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô their ideas and had great results.The problem is what happens if your results aren‚Äôt as rosy as those examples?I feel I can offer a unique perspective here because I launched a product (the first version of¬†inform.ly) last year that ultimately failed. It had over 4,000 free signups and only 15 paid customers ($9 / month). I eventually¬†shut down¬†that version of the product. Here are some of the things I learnt.(The idea was a dashboard that brought together all of your stats into the one place in a simple way).The popular stories you hear about startup validation go something like this:Dropbox started from a 3 minute video posted to Hacker News (more here). As they progressed through the beta they had their signup list jump to 75,000 people in 1 day. Here‚Äôs a cool slideshare from their founder Drew Houston.Well that‚Äôs great if you can get 75,000 optins in 1 day sounds like a good idea but if you don‚Äôt is it a bad idea? Maybe you just don‚Äôt have much kudos on Hacker News?The reality is that most ideas aren‚Äôt going to go viral. Let‚Äôs face it, the chances of you coming up with the next dropbox are fairly minimal. But even if your idea is great will a video showing it‚Äôs features go viral? There are a lot of factors at play there I wouldn‚Äôt be betting on it.As with dropbox above and numerous other examples, email signups is often considered the key indicator of whether an idea is good. With the first version of Informly I had:These may seem like small numbers but for someone who had taken 5 years to built up an email list of 2,000 people in my last business I really felt like I was onto a winner.However as I‚Äôve found with this idea and other versions (more later) there is a very big difference between someone entering their email into a box and someone paying you each month for a product.As part of validating Buffer¬†Joel Gascoigne¬†‚Äúsimply tweeted the link and asked people what they thought of the idea‚Äù.¬†His post on validating Buffer¬†indicates that he read a lot into this including:‚ÄúAfter a few people used it to give me their email and I got some useful feedback via email and Twitter, I considered it validated. In the words of Eric Ries, I had my first validated learning about customers‚Äù.Really? A few of your mates said it was a good idea and therefore it‚Äôs ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô? Obviously it turns out that Buffer was a good idea and a product that people wanted and were willing to pay for but does that mean the validation technique was a good one? I don‚Äôt think so.Here is one of the most well known people in the startup space saying that my idea for Informly was great:Here are some of the things that people around me said at the time of pulling it all together:I could go on. I haven‚Äôt included any solicited testimonials above, I had lot of friends telling me it was a great idea and giving me great testimonials as well. But those above are just the unsolicited ones.When I launched the first version of Informly I had it down as a validation goal to get featured by a respected international tech publication. I would have definitely settled for a local Australian one. In the end I was well stoked to get covered by these and more:This was pretty remarkable given:According to this post by Noah Kagan I should have at least got 12,000 users from the Mashable coverage. Combine that with the others and I should be onto a winner right? Guess how many paid users were sent by the above traffic sources? Zero.Not long after realizing that the idea wasn‚Äôt going to fly I decided to ‚Äòpivot‚Äô to a content marketing Analytics app. This time I was determined to make sure I ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô the idea before working on it for 6 months.So I built a targeted list of keen content marketers and asked them a bunch of questions in a survey. The purpose of the survey was to ascertain:It even included specific questions like ‚ÄòWould you pay for this if I built it‚Äô.¬†The results are above and they are clear (or at least they were to me at the time):After I launched however I found things to be very different:I should blame the product for some of this as it was the best I could do within 6 weeks and needed improvement but the results were shocking to me at the time. How could they be so different from the survey results?Well as Steve Jobs said ‚Äú‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt know what they want until you show it to them.‚Äù The opposite is also true, people don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt want until they see it. Which brings me to the MVP.Ah the much loved ‚ÄòMVP‚Äô or minimum viable product. The concept, introduced by Eric Reis with the Lean Startup movement is simple. Do the least amount possible to ‚Äòvalidate‚Äô the idea. Build a ‚Äòviable‚Äô version of the product and get people using it as opposed to getting it perfect before launching.I find it quite funny that Eric Reis talks about the startup Path in the book. A company who spend 6 months with their team behind close doors before launching path 2.0. The reality is that a lot of great designers and creators don‚Äôt want to release a crappy unfinished product. While it‚Äôs appealing to take the ‚Äòvision‚Äô component out of being an entrepreneur it often doesn‚Äôt play out that way.Most ideas won‚Äôt sell as half-finished unpolished versions of what they should be. Most of the SAAS entrepreneurs I know are slaving away for months if not years on their idea with very little traction. Of course responding to customer feedback is important but is it even possible to release a week old product that people pay for?It might be but it‚Äôs certainly a lot harder than it sounds. Services are infinitely easier. A week ago I launched a new service WP Curve, within 1 week it had built up more recurring revenue than a year working on Informly.Why?There are a lot of reasons but one is that I could easily release a full version of the product from the customer‚Äôs point of view within days. On Saturday I decided to launch a 24 hour developer service for WordPress support and small fixes. By Wednesday I had a website and I have the ability to deliver the service in full (for the first week it was me with a live chat on my mobile phone).I don‚Äôt care what the lean startup gurus say, that is not possible with software.Nathan BarryNathan Barry is a well-connected, skillful entrepreneur who recently tried to build a recurring software business in 6 months. The goal was to get to $5,000 a month. He posted recently after the 6 months was up see this great post.I recently saw Tim Ferris tweet one of Nathan‚Äôs blog posts. He is a very well respected entrepreneur, well connected and very skilled. Checkout the ConvertKit homepage¬†<‚Äî legit.It‚Äôs not clear to me how much recurring revenue he actually built since he mentions that he is including some trial people in his calculations. But its‚Äô clearly well below half of the $5,000 goal.Does that mean it‚Äôs a failure? Even if it‚Äôs $1,000 it‚Äôs more than me and more than most of the other software entrepreneurs I chat with regularly. Building a recurring software business is not easy and some things just take time.Stop fucking with the productOne of the decisions I made in the last few weeks was to focus Informly back on it‚Äôs agency version (which sends simple reports to the clients of web design agencies).To my delight there is a lean startup term specifically for this decision ‚Äì The zoom in pivot!¬†In reality though the decision really was to just take a breath and wait.The irony is that this was the original reason for building the product and this version of the product has existed (in various stages of quality) for a long time ‚Äì at least 3 years). If I wasn‚Äôt so obsessed to find a magical quick fix for the last 12 months perhaps I would have already turned this idea into a valid business.For the first year I was desperate to find that single thing that took my idea from a dream into the next big thing startup. It didn‚Äôt happen. So I chopped and changed a thousand times to try to work out the right ‚Äòformula‚Äô. Sometimes though the answer isn‚Äôt so obvious. The idea doesn‚Äôt go viral. It just takes time.I‚Äôm getting regular new trial customers, a few new paid customers a month (more than the amount that are leaving). It‚Äôs no viral startup but it‚Äôs growing and over time might become something good or even great. Maybe it just needs a bit of space. And a bit of time.Each week we send 1 email to 20,000 smart entrepreneurs just like you. Enter your email below to join the crew.We will not share your email. 100% privacyDan Norris is a co-founder at WP Curve and a passionate entrepreneur with an obsession for content marketing.Great post Dan! This is a good conversation starter, but a few things I disagree with. 1. I don‚Äôt think the concept of validating a startup necessarily points to ‚Äúgoing viral.‚Äù The idea is to eliminate waste. To find out if what you‚Äôre doing works without spending a ton of time and money building something nobody wants.If anything, it‚Äôs less likely to go viral, because you are building from the bottom-up, one person at a time.2. You are right that people telling you an idea is good should not be considered validation. But I think the lean startup method would agree with that.There‚Äôs a big difference between saying you like an idea, and agreeing you will pay for it. But I think true validation is getting paid for something.I do agree, however, that certain software startups are very difficult to validate directly with minimal developing. I have worked with some companies who have spent a lot of time in this tension.But I do agree with Ries when he says that for entrepreneurs, whatever the minimum viable product is in your mind, the actual MVP is probably half that.Hey Micky thanks for the comment mate. The point I guess is if the validation is a clear yes or a clear no then some of these techniques will work but if it‚Äôs in the middle then they won‚Äôt. In my experience people saying they like the idea and people saying they will pay for it are equally useless. It was only when I asked for money that I really knew and no one would have paid for a half finished product. I think one approach that could work is pre-selling. Dane Maxwell and Clay Collins talk about this. The issue here is you need to be a good salesman or have a big audience. But I think it forces you down the path of validating ideas before building anything which is probably a good thing.Completely agree Dan. Talk is cheap.
Really appreciate the work you‚Äôre doing and the content you put out on a regular basis. Keep it up!Dan, I think Micky‚Äôs points are valid. Talking to people about your idea and putting up a signup page does not mean you‚Äôre doing customer development.Qualitative research does work ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt need sales skills ‚Äì in fact selling gets in the way. No-one will tell you that your baby is ugly so don‚Äôt test your idea for a solution until after you really understand if they have a problem they are willing to pay for.
‚Äì Ask what they do now ‚Äî and why
‚Äì See if they have tried to fix it already
‚Äì What is the impact of this problem / why do they care
‚Äì Keep asking why
If you hear passion that is validation. If you hear polite interest that means no.Good points. But having those conversations is a skill. Whether you call it sales or something else.There are several people writing about customer development for startup founders e.g. Kevin Dewalt. He has some very practical blog articles I think you‚Äôll like this http://kevindewalt.com/2013/02/09/how-i-make-customer-development-interviews-less-weird-and-more-natural/Thanks Giles I‚Äôll check this out mate.Agree about the service business, its far easier to start a business idea around a service and then automate it later.  Easy to say in hindsight but informly should have started as a monthly dashboard service run by people instead of code.  Cardmunch is a great example here: sold company to Linkedin that ran on Mechanical Turk.Probably true mate. Thanks for the comment.Thank you.This is my favourite post in a long time.  I get so tired of (what I see as) blatant survivor bias in so much start up writing. Your candidness is encouraging and inspiring.Thanks Barry I agree with you. I wanted to talk about that specifically but it would have been a bit off topic. If I hear one more expert tell me that they achieved success by ‚Äòworking hard‚Äô I‚Äôm going to lose my shit.Hi Dan ‚Äì your honesty is refreshing. I‚Äôve witnessed the same phenomenon where friends and connections will tell you how good your idea is, but when it‚Äôs time to put up or shut up, they choose the latter. I know you‚Äôre a one man band ‚Äì do you have any thoughts on partnering up with a more established entrepreneur in the future? PS ‚Äì I think there‚Äôs a book in this ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòStarting Up ‚Äì I Failed But Still Won‚Äô. I‚Äôm a writer and would love to help write it!Hey Alex I‚Äôve been in business for myself for 7 years so I don‚Äôt think I need more experience. What I do need though is someone with complimentary skills. If I could find someone who could do sales and customer development stuff and I could just focus on product and content I‚Äôd go for it. The problem is finding someone suitable who shares the same ideals, work ethic, someone who I work well with etc. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an easy thing to do. If I was to do it again I‚Äôd consider doing it that way although I am a bit obsessed with getting stuff done myself (probably to my detriment).Lucky comment #100. ABC!*moderates comment haThanks Dan. This is probably the more real life post about validating business ideas I‚Äôve read.Very relevant to what I‚Äôm ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù right now.This is what I did in my first startup attempt:Idea -> Build -> Launch day -> 1.000$ monthly revenue for the whole 2012 -> Unable to grow -> Shut down. This is what I did after reading Lean Startup by Eric Ries, Running Lean by Ash Maurya, etc.:Idea -> MVP -> 2 months testing manually a service with 20 users -> Not enough engagement (I considered) -> Discard the idea not knowing if the MVP was too simple.This is what I‚Äôm trying to do now, after following Steve Blank Udacity course ‚ÄúHow to build a startup‚Äù (https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245) and reading more about customer discovery. Idea -> Forget about idea and try to focus on the problem -> Try to find people to talk about their problems -> Lot of time, difficult to get insights -> Never feeling the idea is worth pursuing.Probably wise but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of it. Let me know how it goes for you. Thanks for the comment too.I‚Äôve got nothing to add‚Ä¶ I enjoyed the read though üôÇHa thanks mate. You are taking a slightly different route with http://fuzedapp.com I‚Äôm keen to see how it works out for you.Dan,
You wrote:
‚ÄúHowever as I‚Äôve found with this idea and other versions (more later)
there is a very big difference between someone entering their email into
 a box and someone paying you each month for a product.‚ÄùAmen! Different scenarios outside the software field are no different. Advisers suggest you conduct a survey of potential customers in your market or create focus groups to determine whether customers are likely to respond positively to your brand. The trouble is that, in the end, the best way to figure out whether someone will buy your product or service is to put it on the market. Not to say there is no value in these other exercises. But it‚Äôs important to understand their limitations. Thanks for sharing with the BizSugar community.Thanks heather yeah I think it applies to all industries just selling an unfinished software product is not easy. It‚Äôs much easier to make it up as you go with services.Responding to your provocative headline‚Ä¶Is ‚Äústartup validation‚Äù bullshit? No.Validation is a journey from ‚ÄúI wonder if this is a good idea‚Äù to ‚ÄúSweet, we have a profitable company.‚ÄùIf your idea doesn‚Äôt suck, you‚Äôre going to get early, positive feedback ‚Äî which can mislead you into thinking the idea is ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù‚Ä¶ and off you go to build it (especially if you‚Äôre more developer than business person ‚Äî because building shit is fun.)My favorite advice to startups is to ask people for pre-orders (with a specific price offer) on the product idea before building anything. Become a push salesperson. People will shift into ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù mode ‚Äî and REAL objections will  come out.Now you have something to work with ‚Äî you need to hear criticism on your plan to solve the customer problem. Too many startups build a product before getting these objections, you‚Äôve left a lot of risk in ‚Äî and disappointment is more likely.Next step, build a MVP and try and collect revenue ASAP ‚Äî launch super early and ask for money ‚Äî expect that your product will be fucked up in enough ways that nobody will pay you. Then, keep working on it until you can get people to pay you. Or eventually give up.This is all incredibly messy (like life) and there are so many variables that following Lean Startup and Running Lean principles absolutely don‚Äôt guarantee success. Even if you get to the ‚Äúsweet, we have a profitable company‚Äù graduation event from startup to company, your victory may be temporary üôÇI like your insight that it‚Äôs easier to start a service company than a product company. I encourage first-time entrepreneurs to build a company that wraps a small product with services vs. doing a pure product as their first entrepreneurial venture.Thanks for your post Dan.Thanks Ryan. I agree with everything you said. The only thing I‚Äôd say about pre-selling though is I suck at sales and I know people who don‚Äôt who could pre-sell anything. Does that make their idea more valid? I guess I was hoping I could find a sweet spot where I could focus in building a product but in the end if you are in business it‚Äôs hard to avoid selling if you want people to buy from you.Good point ‚Äî I forgot to mention that pre-selling must be done by the founders ‚Äî not hired guns ‚Äî because the goal is as much to learn from the objections vs. actually get an order (though getting the order is progress.)‚ÄîOne other insight I HAVE to share‚Ä¶ Recently we build http://cladwell.com in 11 weeks, and our team made more than 800 commits to the git repo during that time. I gave up on several solo projects after 100 or 200 commits, but were made over a much longer timespan.The insight is that being a solo founder adds risk. I‚Äôm pissed at myself for giving up on some of those projects so early (from a commit standpoint).I‚Äôm curious how many commits you‚Äôve made to Informly?Wow that looks interesting I signed up. As for commits I don‚Äôt measure it but we‚Äôve changed the product a LOT. Way too much. I‚Äôve spent a year full time working on it for most of that year I had 2 developers working on it. Probably 70-80% of that work is not being used. It was either a different version of the product that I discontinued or it was a feature that we ended up removing. It‚Äôs been messy.Haha, I LOVE the endorsements on the homepage, they are gold!I tried the service last night it was great. I would totally use it except it doesn‚Äôt really work that well in Australia with the shipping costs etc. The process was great though and I‚Äôm the perfect market for that idea. I hate shopping, don‚Äôt know anything about fashion, don‚Äôt know anything about where to buy stuff online but I‚Äôm happy to pay for a service that tells me what to buy.Great post Dan.  Our startup community has a tendency to ignore all of the exceptions to the ‚Äúrules‚Äù.  But there are lots of them, and your businesses are perfect examples.Thanks Brian I‚Äôm glad you found it useful. We still need to do that podcast!Great post, Dan. I think people sometimes get caught up in iterating on the lean startup with these magical steps thinking that one day they‚Äôll wake up with product/market fit. Truth is it‚Äôs a lot harder than that and a lot of products simply aren‚Äôt useful. Then when you find one that is, most products don‚Äôt take off like Dropbox. Instead they are more like Constant Contact with the ‚ÄúLong, Slow, SaaS Ramp of Death‚Äùhttp://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/gail-goodman-constant-contact-how-to-negotiate-the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death/Thanks for commenting Wade. Yeah I‚Äôve seen that talk it‚Äôs great. I often have to remind myself how many years some of these companies have been around. Contant Contact 15 years old, Aweber 15 years old, Infusionsoft 12 years old etc.Nice share Wade. I enjoyed that üôÇThank you for the reality check. By the way, I love your podcast.Ha thanks mate. I must do another episode!Putting a payment page up is the best test. As Joel from WP Engine says, he had people handing him money for a product he had not created. That was the test.I tested my MVP with a sign up for interest. Got <100 people.Built a MVP coffee subscription. Got 10 signups right away and away I went.Hey Tim it‚Äôs just not as simple as that unfortunately. Joel actually started with an email optin to be notified of launch. He then developed it for 7 weeks and then launched it with a post that got traction on hacker news. Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the common experience if you aren‚Äôt an established founder. Your signup for interest of less than 100 people may have been a good result. Who knows? There are so many factors. Coffee subscription is different as I mention in the post you can run services as an MVP very easily it‚Äôs not the same with software.Thank you Dan‚Ä¶I love your honesty‚Ä¶cheersThankyou KarenEarly feedback is definitely the key. Great post Dan. A lot of insightful info.Thanks Greg.Dan, nice to see someone tell it like it is! I second Barry‚Äôs opinion about survivor bias. The error of this kind of thinking has been well documented in stock trading literature. Unfortunately, in the startup field, no one wants to spoil the dream.Ha thanks Stephen. I‚Äôm happy to spoil it he he.Hey Dan, great post mate and I hope this is a kick in the ass for the delusional among us that think you can build a lasting business in a couple of weeks. That might be the case for the lucky few, but for the rest of us it means days and nights and weekends iterating on the same idea and just working it like a mad man.I personally think your decision to scale it back to the first idea and stop chasing the viral startup myth is a good one. Stick with what works I say, you‚Äôre getting trials and paying customers and people aren‚Äôt leaving. All great signs.Myself and many others are following along, good luck with it all.Thanks man I‚Äôve found myself even doing the same thing with the new service just tinkering with stuff when I don‚Äôt have to. The signs are looking good for it as well so I just need to be patient I think.Thanks Dan. A wonderful post. I can definitely resonate with it. DoraiThanks Dorai thanks for tweeting it too.Dan Norris as I have told you in private I still feel that the Content Marketing ROI version of Inform.ly is the better product and the best problem to solve. Everyone and their mother online is talking about content marketing but there is no real tool out there that literally shows you the return on income on ones content marketing efforts. This tool would have been best for content marketing agencies who produce content for their customers so that they can show them the ROI, they would have been the best customers and secondly the next best customers would have been companies who are already heavily producing content.Secondly, when it comes to MVP, paying customers is not everything. Delivering real value to paying customers is what matters the most. Check out the Max Cameron of Kera interview on Mixergy.Hey Owen thanks mate re point 1. You may be right but in any case I don‚Äôt have the resources to pursue it. What you are describing is not easy. We built the page analytics stuff which was hard enough but there are 2 things that make it even harder. 1 is the fact that at some stage you have to tap into the financial system. Whether that be by adding dollar values to goals like Analytics does (which is only going to work for certain businesses and won‚Äôt be an accurate measure of lifetime value) or 2 tapping into the accounting systems at the back end (could be better but you‚Äôll run into issues with associating visits with who the customer is, i.e. not really being able to track their origin. I think if you were to niche it down to one system like create a content analytics app for infusionsoft users there could be something there. Maybe I‚Äôll do that one day but it‚Äôs no small job and I just ran out of time and resources. I thought it was better to focus on the one that I actually had paying customers for and did solve a real problem. Everyone gets excited about Analytics but in the end most small business owners don‚Äôt really want to pay to look at numbers, they have bigger problems. Most Analytics startups seem to focus on bigger companies which isn‚Äôt something I want to do.  Look at how much KissMetrics is charging now. I don‚Äôt really understand point 2. You say paying customers isn‚Äôt everything but delivering value to paying customers is so I‚Äôm lost on that one. I‚Äôll check out the interview.One thing I know about almost every mid-sized business is; They don‚Äôt measure.
You and I and probably most people commenting have been schooled in measuring and tracking ROI. But from what I can see, nearly every company that employs us for Adwords campaigns or SEO or anything else don‚Äôt actually care about the numbers.Just having a tool that allows them to see some other metric would probably be enough for them to pay for and be happy. EG: This blog post had 15,000 reads! WOOHOO.Well Google Analytics does this, I guess what I was working on was trying to differentiate from that. I think there‚Äôs something for sure. Maybe someone else will do it. That product that Moz brought out certainly does look sexy. I‚Äôm not sure how effective it as at doing what we are talking about as I haven‚Äôt used it.Yeah check out the interview to understand point #2. I am sure you will get it when you listen to it.Regarding point #1 you will definitely need to niche up. To get access to the financial system, for instance you can go after web apps who charge a recurring revenue who can simply link the revenue data to your tool or marketing agencies who create content for web apps.OR create the tool for folks who heavily create content and are users of tools like Hubspot, Marketo, Eloqua, InfusionSoft and so on. These tools already to an extent provide insight on the financial data.If you can build such a tool you literally could charge $99+ or more per month and folks will be willing to pay because the tool will relate revenue to specific content marketing effort.Great post Dan. It‚Äôs hard to admit when a venture doesn‚Äôt work out quite like you expected. I‚Äôve had my own experiences but the good news is we aren‚Äôt alone.I recently covered off my thoughts on this in this post http://typicalbusiness.com/falling-in-love-with-your-ideas/ Overall, I love the way you pivoted ‚Äì that‚Äôs often the biggest hurdle to get around. Falling in love with the original idea and not being willing to shift is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see regularly.Thanks Steve great post, particularly the fans stuff. It‚Äôs great to have people‚Äôs support but you can read too much into it I think. I‚Äôd never built anything that had ever been talked about by anyone of note before Informly so to have all of that external coverage and people talking was very exciting. But realistically not worth as much as a handful of keen customers.On that front Dan, you‚Äôve achieved a lot more than most could imagine. I was saying to Jake Hower the other night that I think it‚Äôs just a matter of time before you hit the big one. Keep up the great work.Let‚Äôs hope so Steve‚ÄúBut realistically not worth as much as a handful of keen customers.‚ÄùHit the nail on the head. My name is not well known and neither is the company. But look at the customer list (testimonials page) and we‚Äôre doing fine. You don‚Äôt need fame and ego stroking. You need customers. The noisy ones that complain and point out bugs and ask for features ‚Äì they are your friends (even if at times they annoy you) ‚Äì they are the ones that will push you to improve the quality and to take the feature set in the direction that provides the most benefit. No easy answer to which suggestions to accept ‚Äì use you best instincts, trust your gut reaction to ideas if you evaluate each idea as yourself being the customer.Great post Dan. I can agree with this as we launched our first product (doccyapp.com) 2 months ago and its hard work and progress is slow. I think everyone thinks its going to be a overnight success story for every startup but its a hard slogHey Michael yeah I think so. Thanks for the comment and good luck with Doccy.Thanks mate its a slog but worth it. Think its important for people to share their experiences that way ppl know what 99% of the services out there go throughSolid post dude. I myself have invested into numerous projects and most of them have failed. Much like leveraging external properties to drive traffic to your websites, I think its smart to do likewise with projects (including the release of new products and services) Work all of them with the least amount of effort, find the ones that work, and ditch the others.Hey John thanks mate. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the answer to be honest. I think focus is better. Despite having 2 projects at the moment I think a better approach is choosing 1 and trying to figure it out. I might have failed a few times at it but I still think it‚Äôs the best way to go. It‚Äôs hard enough to do 1 thing well let alone 3 or 4 you end up spreading yourself too thin and don‚Äôt do any of them justice.Fair point. Do you think it‚Äôs plausible to do 3-4 MVP‚Äôs, though? Like you did with WPLN.Sure, change the 1 idea as much as you need to is better than having 3-4 ideas I reckon.This makes sense and is pretty much what Im doing with BTD. Everyone kept asking me what it was when I first got started. I kept replying ‚ÄúI dont know yet‚Äù ‚Äì lol. Over time the long term plan is becoming much clearer. What‚Äôs great is that I can let the site evolve, I can pivot, shimmy and do whatever I need to in order to make it work. All at the one site ‚Äì not several sites like Ive done in the past which has led to me being overwhelmed.I don‚Äôt know if this is the best strategy either. I think people have to be clear about what you are offering. If people don‚Äôt know what you do then it‚Äôs not a good sign. I‚Äôm not a fan of the name I think that‚Äôs a barrier regardless of what you turn it into. I think thinking about what you are doing as a ‚Äòsite‚Äô is a problem too. You are either trying to build a business and solve problems or you aren‚Äôt. If your site supports it then great but the site isn‚Äôt the business. You have to remember that a lot of the guys in our circles (Schramko etc) all have businesses already and all they need is more people into the funnel. This is a fundamentally different position to what you are in.Thanks for sharing this. I think you also made the ‚Äúmeasuring the wrong things‚Äù mistake, which probably everybody makes to some degree. I tried to sum this up in a brief post:
http://blog.xam.de/2013/07/validation-for-software-products-is-hard.htmlThanks Max yeah I definitely made that mistake. I really like this post http://insideintercom.io/four-pricing-principals-to-never-forget/ particularly the chart on free users vs paid users and the sorts of feedback they give. I definitely fell into this trap.For what it‚Äôs worth, how good is that Inside Intercom blog. Nailing it always.SolidCheck out Bob Dorf on customer validation, business model canvas and lessions from history. He‚Äôs been there, blown it, made it, written about it, got the t-shirt too.http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/07/bob-dorf-co-author-startup-owners-manual-customer-development-the-science-of-acceleration-for-growth-businesses/FWIW, 6 weeks is not enough time. Not nearly enough.Most products are not overnight successes.When I started my current business I spent two years creating it (spare time ‚Äì evenings + weekends and then testing it at my consulting day job), then 9 months full time, then launched 6 months after 9/11 (bad timing), then had the Iraq war (more bad timing ‚Äì as each war starts businesses stop spending for 6 months or more). It‚Äôs a highly technical product with a geek audience. 3 months before first sale, probably 2 or 3 years before it was a self-sustaining business. Business is now in it‚Äôs 12th year. I have a nice business to run and I choose how and when I work.Stephen KellettI 100% agree with you! Software apps whereby one charges a recurring fee is a very very scalable business model! That said it is still a business and it takes time even years to fully work out all the kinks.Here are some steps to consider at the early stages of a software app startup and each one takes time.1) Figure out a specifically identifiable group of people to solve a problem for.2) Figure out the most burning pain/problem that they are willing to pay you to solve.3) Build the MVP solution that solves the problem4) Build a Repeatable and Predictable Customer Acquisition Process that can turn site visitors into leads, leads into trial users, and trial users into paying customers.5) Once the predictable marketing system of step 4 above is in place then it‚Äôs time to grow, pump as much paid traffic as you can to itAs you can see these 5 steps highlighted so far only covering the first two stages of running a successful software business as suggested by David Cummings, co-founder of Pardot which recent got sold for about $100million to ExactTarget (<<<‚Äî see http://davidcummings.org/2013/07/05/the-four-stages-of-a-b2b-startup/) In total it was a 5.5 year process (<<<‚Äî see http://davidcummings.org/2012/11/17/key-moments-in-the-life-of-pardot/)Skip the trial!!! If there is value they will pay. If not, they will not not. Their cost in not the price if there is value ‚Äî it is it the changing the way they do business that is the hardest road block.Skip the free trial.Hi Owen this advice sounds great. I have found it‚Äôs not quite as simple as that for me once you start to make it happen. If you are able to pull it off then please send the guest post my way I‚Äôd love to have it on the blog!It not meant to be simple, each stage comes with it‚Äôs own challenges and I‚Äôd gladly blog about it when the time comes. BTW in my case for SweetProcess it will be due to the combined efforts of my wonderful co-founders; Brian, Jervis and IThanks Stephen this looks great I‚Äôll check it out. Yeah the mistake with the content analytics product wasn‚Äôt killing it after 6 weeks it was starting it in the first place knowing full well I couldn‚Äôt dedicate enough time and resources to make it work. The other product I had worked on for 1 year full time and probably 2 more years part time, I had been going at it for a while. Great to hear about your persistence. I fear I don‚Äôt have the patience to pull that off and that definitely hurts me at times.Awesome post, thanks Dan.  That‚Äôs brutal that inform.ly didn‚Äôt work out.  I still kind of can‚Äôt believe that it didn‚Äôt work out, I was following the progress through your email blasts and such, and it sounded like it was definitely going to work. Especially with all of that validation and positive feedback that you got.I don‚Äôt really know anything about building a successful product, but just wanted to share a few thoughts.I ran into something similar with the last product that I tried to build.  Got a lot of great feedback, got a few sales, but then didn‚Äôt end up getting as many as I would have liked.One of the problems with the particular product that I was building was that the value proposition wasn‚Äôt a very easy sell.  It was basically for upgrading software, and it was the kind of thing people hated to do in the Magento world and that they knew they had to do.But at the end of the day, unless there was a very specific bug that was losing them money every day, or a new feature they needed that would make them money, they really couldn‚Äôt be bothered to upgrade.And I can‚Äôt blame them, it makes sense.So one of the big things that I changed in the way I‚Äôm approaching building a product is that I‚Äôm hyper-focused on building something that creates value (and by value I mean money specifically), regardless of whether there‚Äôs necessarily a demand for it or whether the potential customers think they are going to want it.So the product I‚Äôm building now is actually able to calculate the ROI that it is driving.  One of the nice things about working in Magento specifically (eCommerce platform) is that I‚Äôm able to do that pretty easily since sales are flowing through the platform, I know that‚Äôs not an option for every software product out there.And I‚Äôm not sure how much demand there is going to be for it, but because I know for a fact that this piece of software will make people money if they use it, I‚Äôm going to keep pushing even if there isn‚Äôt too much interest at first.  Hopefully get up that slow ramp of death üôÇThanks again for the post!Hey Kalen thanks mate yeah if you can find a situation where you are making more money than it costs people to use your service then it‚Äôs a very good start. It‚Äôs not a guarantee though because some people don‚Äôt act as logically as you or I do. But definitely it helps in selling something that you can prove that it will return it‚Äôs value.One thing I learned a while back, is that just because there is a need, it does not mean there is a market. There is a lot of ‚Äúcool, I could really use that.‚Äù There is much, much fewer, ‚Äúcool, here is my credit card number.‚ÄùI also learned start-ups and freelancers are NOT a viable market. Both are trying to trade their time for money and have no money to trade on saving time. Only want the free version and usually will not pay.By and large, you need to target a business that will pay to solve a pain point or need help on resources (time, but this needs to be compelling, as time ROI is a hard sell). Also, can target a hardcore consumer segment, such as a high priced hobby.I thought your content marketing product may have had legs‚Ä¶ but it was too technical to make work for most of us. And your price point was too low. Remember the price is NOT the sticker price ‚Ä¶ that is almost incidental if there is value. The real price is changing the way we do things.Good luck.Thanks Greg good insights.I can verify these points. Along our journey we‚Äôve had various startups (a few big names too, now defunct) that said they‚Äôd purchase. Very few ever do and even when they do, they don‚Äôt purchase much.You want customers that are not startups but real businesses looking to be more efficient, more effective and that value what you provide.Sounds great Dan. As a someone who has gone through stages you have already passed, your insights seems intuitive to me. There are times in our product cycle that a mvp is not just enough, specially if you are trying to sell something. While giving response people tend to behave differently then people who are real buyers of product. That being said, the thing I like about MVP is speed, a must. That helps not going into micro-engineering every aspect and produce first improve later approach. May be in 2015, someone will comeup with a new strategy, and then in 2017 and so on. What‚Äôs the point ? We got to do something right at the moment and evolve naturally.Thanks mate agreed.Excellent post Dan. What is funny is that I randomly found Inform.ly because I had an itch to scratch. I think your trials and tribulations reflect what most startups go through. It‚Äôs called reality, and doesn‚Äôt make the news. In addition to experience, you also bring some great business skills to the table. Thanks for sharing that with everyone.Thanks John I appreciate that.Great post. I do not think that anything went wrong. The only thing that is way too overhyped is how success stories do their business and get traction. I do not think that they are more conscious on how they got there than Google or Facebook. (if they knew it they could repeat their original success which they could not, in fact.) And see how many times they fail. Especially Google: they are awesome at failing again and again and again.There is no formula for success. We are experimenting with defining the key emotional impacts users are looking for. Focusing on functions solely we push our customers to focus on functions that create the perceived quality customers are looking for (this is not the same as UX). We are pretty successful with it but still it helps only to define the potential that can be achieved with the product. It also helps to stay focused on what you need to deliver.Still I have not seen anything that will tell you when to enter the market and what is your exact market. You can forget lean canvas and all other overhyped bullshit methods. The secret sauce is still out there for someone to define.Great post Dan and gives me some stuff to think about before I start my next adventure.Awesome mate great to hear. Let me know how it goes for you.Hi Dan,Great post with lots of thought provoking points.I‚Äôve often wondered if what you end up testing is a particular landing page or messaging or ads vs actual product potential? There are so many variables in play that you could have a great product but the test results may not be well correlated.Hope that makes some sense.Thanks again for writing it.JulyHey Julio thanks mate yeah I did a bunch of split tests for new features as well I didn‚Äôt include those above. I didn‚Äôt really get a whole lot of validation from those either, I had tests for new features under-perform conversions on the existing pages, changing from features to benefits having minimal impact etc. I guess in the end you have to make your own decisions based on what is generally incomplete data.And,I‚Äôd thought of something just like the original Inform.ly just a month or so after you did and actually shied away because I didn‚Äôt think I could do a better job than you were.  I‚Äôve been following you all along.  It‚Äôs kind of sobering to see behind that curtain‚Äìthanks for taking the bullet for us!Thanks also for pointing out the survivor bias in everything we read.  I used to buy it all hook, line, and sinker and it made me feel terrible.  But thanks to honest, transparent posts like yours and others, I realized I‚Äôm actually better off than some of the people I‚Äôve been admiring all along and there isn‚Äôt any magic formula to overnight success.  Anyway, I‚Äôm about to pull the trigger on another product instead.  Keeping my fingers crossed:
http://www.thedwick.com/2013/07/a-tale-of-two-products/I‚Äôd love to buy you a beer or several.  I think we‚Äôd have some good stories to swap.Thanks man sounds cool, let me know when you launch something I‚Äôll have a play!Hey Dan thanks for your transparency in this post.  I have had some of the same frustrations with the validation process with a software product that I have been working on with a client. I think one of the main problems is the definition of ‚ÄúValidation‚Äù as the process is a little bit more complicated than sending out a tweet and having a response.  One guy that you have to read is Peter Eerling‚Äôs blog, especially his series on going from Services to Product. This post alone (http://blog.eerlings.com/index.php/2013/04/04/how-solving-a-real-pain-makes-us-already-1000-a-month-even-before-the-big-launch/)  answers much of your software frustrations from Inform.ly.Look forward to listening to your podcast interview on Start Up‚Äôs for the Rest of Us.Thanks Mike I‚Äôm checking this one out now.I think the idea with MVP is the features that are implemented are highly polished and well designed. You‚Äôre just leaving out features that aren‚Äôt really needed to solve the problem (eye candy, bells-and-whistles etc)Easier said than done in my experience.Pingback: Sun Up, Sun Down, It‚Äôs the September Best of the Web! | Firepole Marketing Blog()Pingback: Worried someone's going to steal your idea? Here are 4 things you should worry about instead()Awesome post, thanks. And Steve Blank may say you have a good lifestyle business, not quite a startup.Thanks mate. Glad you liked it. I remember when Jason Calacanis accused DHH of having a lifestyle business. Pretty solid lifestyle business that one turned out to be.Always appreciate your honesty when it comes to startups Dan. Good read.Thanks Osman.‚ÄúTargeted Surveys don‚Äôt work‚Äù ‚Äì I shit you not. I slaved away for weeks to create a product based on my audience survey answers, released a beta version for $17 and 9 people bought it.9 sounds good. I had about 20 people tell me they‚Äôd pay for something and I think 1 of them did. Surveys for the lose.Hey Dan ‚Äì I agree that email optins and bet a testers don‚Äôt mean you have an idea worth pursuing. I built WP Elevation into a six figure business with steady recurring monthly revenue by throwing up a landing page on Unbounce.com and selling tickets to a webinar ($97 p/head) before I had built the webinar. This webinar went on to become the business accelerator program that it is today based on feedback from those original webinar attendees.The lesson here is that people paying you money is a far better indicator that you‚Äôre onto something than an email address.I presented how I did this at the Phoenix Lean Startup MeetUp via Google Hangout yesterday:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8aHcXI56kcKeep up the awesomeness mate.Hey Troy this is cool, I guess the point I‚Äôd make (which I also made in the article) is that validation is pretty clear when the results are obvious. Like if you have an audience and you sell them a webinar and you get way more signups than you expected then happy days. The problem is a lot of people don‚Äôt get that clearly positive result. In that case it‚Äôs not quite as simple. Having an audience is a huge asset too as we‚Äôve discovered with all of the things we‚Äôve launched this year.Belated comment ‚Äì listened to you on Foolish Adventure ‚Äì WPCurve looks great ‚Äì looks like there is plenty of niche there for this sort of micro support.  by the way your twitter links dont work in footer üôÇThanks Kieran I‚Äôll check the footer.This is still some amazing stuff!  So I‚Äôve been thinking about this problem for a while now (product or idea validation)‚Ä¶and I see that there are a few ‚Äògo-to‚Äô products for this that don‚Äôt actually work (LaunchRock, Unbounce, QuickMVP, etc.).  Sure, you may get those email addresses and lot‚Äôs of feedback in a ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait until you launch!‚Äù kind of way; but when the order form pops up‚Ä¶crickets‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm proposing a new way to validate ideas without having to build your product:  What if you could set up a ‚Äòsales funnel‚Äô type of process which would take users through a three question survey (beautiful pages with awesome animations & very clear goals for each question, ie. ‚Äòattention‚Äô and ‚Äòinterest‚Äô) while using some proven conversion techniques (like countdown timers, exit popovers, etc.) along the way.  Before visitors start the survey, they may be asked to ‚Äòregister‚Äô for a free gift after completing the survey, or not.  If this option is used, then users would have a list of email addresses before the survey started.  I would suggest a separate email sequence directed to these users.  At the end of the three question survey (takes 10 ‚Äì 15 seconds), visitors would be presented with the ‚Äòidea landing page‚Äô, a beta price, terms, and a ‚Äòbuy now‚Äô button.  If they click the buy now button, they would be presented with a Stripe form where visitors could purchase early access at the beta price.  The ‚Äòthank you‚Äô page could then be used to reinforce the understanding that the product is not yet available, give an estimate on when it will be and when their card will be charged, and allow the visitor to share this idea via social networks.  Their email address (from the Stripe form) would then be sent to the user‚Äôs email service (via API ‚Äì Mailchimp, Aweber, etc.) and users would be able to continue communications with them (via email auto-responder sequence).So this would be a collection of concepts (survey, idea validation, crowdfunding) which would really solve this whole problem for everyone!  Any thoughts?Hey Phil thanks mate. This seems like rather than proposing a new validation technique you are combining a bunch of existing ones? I think it‚Äôs flawed for a few reasons. First off the survey is pointless, it‚Äôs great to build an email list but it‚Äôs not validation. Having a ‚Äòbeta price‚Äô means you are presenting people with an unrealistic offer so whether or not they are actually interested in your final offer isn‚Äôt being tested. Using every conversion trick in the book might get them to buy out of interest or excitement but does it mean they really need it? I get emails from people all the time who have been able to get early users on at a great price and they go on to never use the service. What does that mean? It means they signed up because it sounded interesting  But it really wasn‚Äôt tapping into a big need. And in that case it will ultimately fail if they can‚Äôt work out how to tap into a more pressing need. It‚Äôs also preselling which I address in the post above. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the answer to startup validation. I‚Äôll give you an idea of how hard it is to know if something will make a good business,even after launch, let alone before.We launched our community a while after launching WP Curve. No tricks, no surveys or preselling just sign up for $30 / month.  In the first week we had 30 paying customers and we had 40 by the end of the month. That was 3x as many as we had with WP Curve. We were very excited. Now WP Curve has 250 customers and is doing $17,000 / month and the community was shut down because it failed badly. We never got more than 40 customers. Both of those are great outcomes because they happened very quickly. The best solution I can find is to launch and learn as quickly as you can. We‚Äôve started 3 businesses in the last 12 months, all launched within 7days. 2 failed badly, one is going very well. I go through this in more detail in my upcoming free book http://wpcurve.com/7daystartup. Thanks for commenting mate.Hmmm‚Ä¶while I don‚Äôt agree with your assertion that the survey would be pointless, I accept your point that overall, my idea would not work as I thought.  You really bring up some great points!  Thanks for answering.So, if you were to comment offhandedly about some way you would use to validate an idea for a SAAS project, what would you recommend? I‚Äôve have a software framework which allows HTML savvy non-technical users a quick way of building a working prototype.  It uses the PHP CodeIgniter framework with several choices of Twitter Bootstrap HTML themes; and includes user authentication, product and user management, and payment integration modules already built-in.  All a user would have to do is choose their payment model and add prototype pages which link to each other.  Now when they hand this over to a programming team, they will save weeks of development time or thousands of dollars in coding cost.How do you think I validate this?I don‚Äôt think of things in terms of validated and not validated. There are just too many factors. For a bootstrapped business I would choose an idea that I could launch quickly (see http://wpcurve.com/business-ideas/) then I would look for momentum and try to follow it (see my interview on here http://goo.gl/kSU1kp )For a funded company I would just generally apply a bunch of principles that have worked well for me which I discussed in the interview above. Namely launching and learning as quickly as possible, looking for sources of momentum and generally looking at metrics associated with people spending money before optimizing every step of the funnel like most advice seems to suggest. The hard part initially is just getting your idea in front of enough of the right people. If you can do that and you aren‚Äôt seeing signups then it‚Äôs not a good sign. Your idea would be tough for a lot of reasons. It‚Äôs very hard to find a HTML savvy non technical person. More to the point you need a HTML savvy non technical person who isn‚Äôt close to and taking advice from a technical person (because they won‚Äôt recommend a solution like yours I wouldn‚Äôt have thought). It sounds like a complex thing to build for a bootstrapper as well. You can do a fair amount of work before you invest in building it. I wouldn‚Äôt call it validating but you can start to understand some of the fundamentals with some good questions. For example say you find a handful of people who tell you, they are keen on this idea. The first thing I would ask them is what steps have they taken to solve this problem before. If they haven‚Äôt taken any it‚Äôs a bad sign. If they‚Äôve taken some steps but none of them involve paying money, it‚Äôs a bad sign. If they‚Äôve tried other paid solutions to the problem but they weren‚Äôt quite right, then you have learnt a few valuable things. Firstly where to find ideal customers (people who use these other solutions), and secondly what kind of features might appeal to your customers (what features are lacking in the other products). This is much more difficult than a lot of people make out. It‚Äôs not an exact science.Very good!  Thank you so much for the advice!  Also, thanks for direction to your interview on startupsfortherestofus.  I am right there where you were 10 months before the interview‚Ä¶a few weeks away from having to get a j.o.b.  üôÇ  I recently launched two products in the ‚Äòinternet marketing‚Äô web space.  I had Mark Thompson launch EngageRocket, and Ben Adkins promoted Freegiftr.  I had pretty good success with these; but they were short-term launches‚Ä¶nothing recurring.  Combined they brought in about $125K, but of course a lot of that went to the successful affiliates.  Anyway, so I really thought I had a knack for building software as a non-technical manager (another company is giving me 12% gross for a project I managed).  Now, I just have to find the right idea, then validate it, and get it built (oh, I have a fantastic technical founder, btw!)‚Ä¶  I appreciate your following up with me, Dan.  Let me know if there is anything you think I could do to help you anytime.No worries man stay in touch and best of luck. Let us know how you get on.Thanks for sharing, Dan! That was an awesome read. I have a similar experience with a software product that me and the team were trying to launch last year. We started with a landing page like you. It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúvalidate‚Äù well. We got unclear feedback. We went on to build the MVP anyway and it turned out that people actually wanted and needed it. The problem was that we had positioned it the wrong way. Our audience just didn‚Äôt understand what we were offering and that it was the thing that they wanted. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs important to speak the audience‚Äôs language.Eversince I‚Äôve been a fan of market research and I try to become a part of the audience before launching even a simple landing page. Also, our product ideas are now based on actual problems that people complain about.Like you, I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúcustomer interviews‚Äù or ‚Äúsurveys‚Äù. This is artificially generated data. There are lots of factors that will make your survey data worthless‚Äîpeople are inclined to be nice even to strangers, ‚Äúsure I‚Äôd buy it‚Äù isn‚Äôt like ‚Äúpre-order now‚Äù, and so on. So, a better way seems to participate in the potential customers‚Äô community directly. At this point my method is: research > landing page > content marketing + start coding. I believe that coding never comes first. In fact, if I had to build a software product now, I‚Äôd postpone coding for as long as I can, until I‚Äôm fairly certain that there is a group of people interested in it. I do agree with Eric Ries that it‚Äôs about number of iterations. The faster you can do these, the faster you can find something that will actually make money. However, I don‚Äôt believe in iterating on software, because I don‚Äôt know of a fast and reliable way that a 1-2 person team can do these. It always turns out crappy. By contrast, iterating on a landing page or a website can be done much faster. There is always risk involved. I don‚Äôt know of any sure-fire method yet. There are just some methods that give better results than others. For example, I find it easier to research the audience and figure out what problems they have, instead of trying to convince them that they need what I think they need (i.e. basing the product off an idea). The closer you are to the audience, the better chance you have of starting out closer to ‚Äúan obvious YES‚Äù. In any case, overnight success happens over many many nights. Of that I‚Äôm certain. üôÇThanks for your comment. I‚Äôm glad you have figured some of it out but you are right it‚Äôs not an exact science and every situation is different. I think launching quickly and building something that is easy to launch quickly is a good way to go for first time entrepreneurs. I ended up writing this book about it http://wpcurve.com/7daystartup it all started on this post.Great read Dan. Im curious, if all of these tools you wrote about don‚Äôt work. What are the key metrics you should be looking for when validating your idea?ThanksHi Jeremy my book is the best follow up from this post. It‚Äôs $4 and it‚Äôs the #2 startup book on Amazon at the moment. http://www.amazon.com/Day-Startup-Learn-Until-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420183651&sr=8-1&keywords=7+day+startupIt all started from this post.Hi Dan,Great I‚Äôll buy and have a read!
I‚Äôm at  a stage of validating my business idea, I created a landing page.
How did u manage to get your page to your specific market eg. did you use a lot of facebook ads?No I‚Äôve only ever done content marketing. I like free methods for early businesses. There is too much unknown for paid options to be worthwhile I think. I‚Äôve put 20 ideas in a marketing PDF up on the resources page up here for the book too http://wpcurve.com/the-7-day-startup-resources/David,

358,6817733,Why I Make Terrible Decisions,http://killermartinis.kinja.com/why-i-make-terrible-decisions-or-poverty-thoughts-1450123558,2013,"There's no way to structure this coherently. They are random observations that might help explain the mental processes. But often, I think that we look at the academic problems of poverty and have no idea of the why. We know the what and the how, and we can see systemic problems, but it's rare to have a poor person actually explain it on their own behalf. So this is me doing that, sort of. AdvertisementRest is a luxury for the rich. I get up at 6AM, go to school (I have a full courseload, but I only have to go to two in-person classes) then work, then I get the kids, then I pick up my husband, then I have half an hour to change and go to Job 2. I get home from that at around 1230AM, then I have the rest of my classes and work to tend to. I'm in bed by 3. This isn't every day, I have two days off a week from each of my obligations. I use that time to clean the house and soothe Mr. Martini and see the kids for longer than an hour and catch up on schoolwork. Those nights I'm in bed by midnight, but if I go to bed too early I won't be able to stay up the other nights because I'll fuck my pattern up, and I drive an hour home from Job 2 so I can't afford to be sleepy. I never get a day off from work unless I am fairly sick. It doesn't leave you much room to think about what you are doing, only to attend to the next thing and the next. Planning isn't in the mix.When I was pregnant the first time, I was living in a weekly motel for some time. I had a minifridge with no freezer and a microwave. I was on WIC. I ate peanut butter from the jar and frozen burritos because they were 12/$2. Had I had a stove, I couldn't have made beef burritos that cheaply. And I needed the meat, I was pregnant. I might not have had any prenatal care, but I am intelligent enough to eat protein and iron whilst knocked up.AdvertisementI know how to cook. I had to take Home Ec to graduate high school. Most people on my level didn't. Broccoli is intimidating. You have to have a working stove, and pots, and spices, and you'll have to do the dishes no matter how tired you are or they'll attract bugs. It is a huge new skill for a lot of people. That's not great, but it's true. And if you fuck it up, you could make your family sick. We have learned not to try too hard to be middle-class. It never works out well and always makes you feel worse for having tried and failed yet again. Better not to try. It makes more sense to get food that you know will be palatable and cheap and that keeps well. Junk food is a pleasure that we are allowed to have; why would we give that up? We have very few of them.The closest Planned Parenthood to me is three hours. That's a lot of money in gas. Lots of women can't afford that, and even if you live near one you probably don't want to be seen coming in and out in a lot of areas. We're aware that we are not ""having kids,"" we're ""breeding."" We have kids for much the same reasons that I imagine rich people do. Urge to propagate and all. Nobody likes poor people procreating, but they judge abortion even harder. Convenience food is just that. And we are not allowed many conveniences. Especially since the Patriot Act passed, it's hard to get a bank account. But without one, you spend a lot of time figuring out where to cash a check and get money orders to pay bills. Most motels now have a no-credit-card-no-room policy. I wandered around SF for five hours in the rain once with nearly a thousand dollars on me and could not rent a room even if I gave them a $500 cash deposit and surrendered my cell phone to the desk to hold as surety.SponsoredNobody gives enough thought to depression. You have to understand that we know that we will never not feel tired. We will never feel hopeful. We will never get a vacation. Ever. We know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn't give us much reason to improve ourselves. We don't apply for jobs because we know we can't afford to look nice enough to hold them. I would make a super legal secretary, but I've been turned down more than once because I ""don't fit the image of the firm,"" which is a nice way of saying ""gtfo, pov."" I am good enough to cook the food, hidden away in the kitchen, but my boss won't make me a server because I don't ""fit the corporate image."" I am not beautiful. I have missing teeth and skin that looks like it will when you live on b12 and coffee and nicotine and no sleep. Beauty is a thing you get when you can afford it, and that's how you get the job that you need in order to be beautiful. There isn't much point trying.Cooking attracts roaches. Nobody realizes that. I've spent a lot of hours impaling roach bodies and leaving them out on toothpick pikes to discourage others from entering. It doesn't work, but is amusing.AdvertisementAdvertisement""Free"" only exists for rich people. It's great that there's a bowl of condoms at my school, but most poor people will never set foot on a college campus. We don't belong there. There's a clinic? Great! There's still a copay. We're not going. Besides, all they'll tell you at the clinic is that you need to see a specialist, which seriously? Might as well be located on Mars for how accessible it is. ""Low-cost"" and ""sliding scale"" sounds like ""money you have to spend"" to me, and they can't actually help you anyway. I smoke. It's expensive. It's also the best option. You see, I am always, always exhausted. It's a stimulant. When I am too tired to walk one more step, I can smoke and go for another hour. When I am enraged and beaten down and incapable of accomplishing one more thing, I can smoke and I feel a little better, just for a minute. It is the only relaxation I am allowed. It is not a good decision, but it is the only one that I have access to. It is the only thing I have found that keeps me from collapsing or exploding.I make a lot of poor financial decisions. None of them matter, in the long term. I will never not be poor, so what does it matter if I don't pay a thing and a half this week instead of just one thing? It's not like the sacrifice will result in improved circumstances; the thing holding me back isn't that I blow five bucks at Wendy's. It's that now that I have proven that I am a Poor Person that is all that I am or ever will be. It is not worth it to me to live a bleak life devoid of small pleasures so that one day I can make a single large purchase. I will never have large pleasures to hold on to. There's a certain pull to live what bits of life you can while there's money in your pocket, because no matter how responsible you are you will be broke in three days anyway. When you never have enough money it ceases to have meaning. I imagine having a lot of it is the same thing.AdvertisementPoverty is bleak and cuts off your long-term brain. It's why you see people with four different babydaddies instead of one. You grab a bit of connection wherever you can to survive. You have no idea how strong the pull to feel worthwhile is. It's more basic than food. You go to these people who make you feel lovely for an hour that one time, and that's all you get. You're probably not compatible with them for anything long-term, but right this minute they can make you feel powerful and valuable. It does not matter what will happen in a month. Whatever happens in a month is probably going to be just about as indifferent as whatever happened today or last week. None of it matters. We don't plan long-term because if we do we'll just get our hearts broken. It's best not to hope. You just take what you can get as you spot it.I am not asking for sympathy. I am just trying to explain, on a human level, how it is that people make what look from the outside like awful decisions. This is what our lives are like, and here are our defense mechanisms, and here is why we think differently. It's certainly self-defeating, but it's safer. That's all. I hope it helps make sense of it.Update: The response to this piece is overwhelming. I have had a lot of people ask to use my work. Please do. Share it with the world if you found value in it. Please link back if you can. If you are teaching, I am happy to discuss this with or clarify for you, and you can freely use this piece in your classes. Please do let me know where you teach. You can reach me on Twitter, Tumblr, on my website, or by email.AdvertisementAdvertisementUnderstand that I wrote this as an example of the thought process that we struggle with. Most of us are clinically depressed, and we do not get therapy and medication and support. We get told to get over it. And we find ways to cope. I am not saying that people live without hope entirely; that is not human nature. But these are the thoughts that are never too far away, that creep up on us every chance they get, that prey on our better judgement when we are tired and stressed and weakened. We maintain a constant vigil against these thoughts, because we are afraid that if we speak them aloud or even articulate them in our heads they will become unmanageably real.Thank you for reading. I am glad people find value in it. Because I am getting tired of people not reading this and then commenting anyway, I am making a few things clear: not all of this piece is about me. That is why I said that they were observations. And this piece is not all of me: that is why I said that they were random observations rather than complete ones. If you really have to urge me to abort or keep my knees closed or wonder whether I can fax you my citizenship documents or if I really in fact have been poor because I know multisyllabic words, I would like to ask that you read the comments and see whether anyone has made your point in the particular fashion you intend to. It is not that I mind trolls so much, it's that they're getting repetitive and if you have to say nothing I hope you can at least do it in an entertaining fashion. If, however, you simply are curious about something and actually want to have a conversation, I do not mind repeating myself because those conversations are valuable and not actually repetitive. They tend to be very specific to the asker, and I am happy to shed any light I can. I do not mind honest questions. They are why I wrote this piece.AdvertisementThank you all, so much. I don't know what life will look like next week, and for once that's a good thing. And I have you to thank."

On the eve of the event managers &quot;young state&quot; collected asset reigning terrorist movement &quot;Donetsk Republic&quot; (the &quot;DNR&quot; in feykovyh elections involving public organizations and movements rather than parties) and initiated a full-scale start partbudivnytstva in the occupied territory of Donetsk region.&quot;The main topic of the meeting - the structure of GH&quot; Donetsk Republic &quot;, the creation and development of local departments of social movements, community liaison work&quot;, - said participants of the meeting.In addition, the top terrorist was determined from the content of the campaign. In particular Purhin noted that the principles on which the &quot;social movement&quot; is a &quot;regional patriotism, revival of the Russian Orthodox Church - as moderator of morals and morality, collectivism as the basis of unity of society - justice and democracy. In addition, he emphasized that the &quot;Donetsk and Luhansk people&#39;s republic&quot; - is part of the &quot;Russian world&quot;.Also militants firmly decide to carry &quot;hundyayevski spiritual skryepy&quot; to the masses and to hold a wider gathering - &quot;Congress&quot;.&quot;We need to talk to people. Meet, to explain, to help. We do everything together. We have no other choice - to go forward,&quot; - said &quot;the first deputy head of the executive committee&quot; Catherine Martyanova.Notably, one of the leaders rashystiv is the current chief thriller &quot;DNR&quot; Alexander Zakharchenko, which has long been closely associated with Ukraine&#39;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, who, according to media reports, previously worked in the structures close to Rinat Akhmetov and associates MPs from the party of regions.Moreover, the Russian &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, citing sources in the administration of Vladimir Putin extended the information that Akhmetov is requested to appoint the head of Vladislav Surkov &quot;DNR&quot; Alexander Zakharchenko. Chairman of the terrorist movement is smotryaschiy Moscow, called the head of the &quot;People&#39;s Council DNR&quot; Andrew Purhin who allegedly created the organization in 2005 and the head of &quot;executive committee&quot; - close to Akhmetov former MMMschyk Denis Pushilin. Notably, trimming outside the control of the militants, who now continues in the Luhansk region, the &quot;DNR&quot; It&#39;s been a long time and safely - after removing the &quot;Moscow group&quot; in osobii Beard and girkin power in the &quot;DNR&quot; into the hands of people who somehow floor &#39; connected with Akhmetov. And now it remains only to legalize puppets controlled via feykovyh elections and finally consolidate the former fiefdom.Akhmetov has been repeatedly accused of having links with terrorists. In particular, the noteworthy fact that terrorists in the occupied territories is not only free to let humanitarian convoys from Akhmetov unlike assistance from Ukraine, and look forward to them. In addition, in late November hacker organization &quot;Humpty Boltay&quot; published online letters array, which is owned such a George Gavrish, which among other things said that Akhmetov finances battalion &quot;Vostok&quot;.Click to enlargeClick to enlarge¬†And although the oligarch until recently, denies neupynno by militants, his actions tell quite a different story. The enterprises of Rinat Akhmetov, including &quot;Donetskgormash&quot; militants began the production of mortars and announced &quot;nationalization&quot; of its businesses have not started. In addition, recently the chief editor of &quot;Today&quot;, owned by Akhmetov was appointed conductor of the famous Ukrainophobe and &quot;Russian world&quot; Olesya elder.So while Rinat repeats like a mantra &quot;Donbass - is Ukraine&quot; and steamed to &quot;humanitartsi&quot; militants under his control blood poured earth, which for decades was considered his fiefdom.¬†Martha Bush, National Bureau of Investigation UkrainecommentsPodilytys link:"
363,8573009,Takeaways from UX Futures Summit 2014,http://blog.trackduck.com/2014/11/07/takeaways-ux-futures-summit-2014/,2014,"A few days ago¬†I was more than excited to watch the UX Futures 2014 online conference that brought some of the most notable experts and thought leaders in the UX field. Even though I only had an opportunity to listen to the presentations of Andy Polaine, Abby Covert and Steve Crug, this didn‚Äôt prevent me from getting a great dose of inspiration and insights from the event.As a result, I would like to share with you my most memorable takeaways from these presentations.Andy Polaine is a service/interaction design consultant and the co-author of Service Design: From Insight to Implementation. In his presentation Design to the Power of Ten Andy covered the main challenges and opportunities that service designers face.The main idea behind the title of his presentation is that even a single touchpoint can wreck an entire ecosystem. One of the most hilarious examples Andy presented was the Myki card and the poor communication on how to use it.Source: Andy Polaine speaker deck¬†At first sight it might look straightforward, just take your card and tap it to the reader. However, what Myki has forgotten to communicate is that their card readers are slow as hell. As a consequence of this, people didn‚Äôt know what to do once they tapped their card to the reader and didn‚Äôt get a response as quickly as they expected. The result appeared to be more than hilarious.Source:¬†Andy Polaine speaker deckAnother interesting point Andy Polaine addressed is that the UX/Service design is like a ‚ÄúTrojan Horse‚Äù for cultural change; and all of us should be aware of how powerful it can be. Andy sees the future where we design services with as much care as we design products right now.Abby Covert is an independent information architect and the author of How to Make Sense of any Mess. In her presentation A World Made of Information Abby discussed the best ways of how to architect information in today‚Äôs world.One of the most eye-opening things I‚Äôve heard during her presentation is that we often consider the definitions of Data, Content and Information as synonyms; although they have very different meanings.To highlight the main differences between these definitions Abby provided an example with a plate of cookies and what different types of information it could provide to us.Source:¬†abbytheia.comBelow is a table from the presentation showing the main differences between these definitions in the context of cookies:Source:¬†abbytheia.comWhat Abby wanted us to understand is that the absence of content or data can be just as informing as the presence and that sometimes we can‚Äôt produce information ourselves ‚Äì our users/clients do that for us.Source:¬†abbytheia.comSteve Krug is the author of Don‚Äôt Make Me Think and Rocket Surgery Made Easy. During his presentation What If It Turns Out Steve Jobs Wasn‚Äôt an Alien Steven showed a short film made by Apple in 1987. The film titled The Knowledge Navigator reveals how Apple imagined the future of computers 27 years ago!Much to my surprise, almost all the visionary features that were shown in that film are pretty much the same as what we have today.If you have anything you would like to add, don‚Äôt hesitate to leave your thoughts in the comments below!UI Designer / Content Crafter at TrackDuckTrackDuck is a visual bug-tracking tool for web projects saving up to 80% of time spent on remote communication.

364,8916731,How the Tinggly startup cope with remote collaboration,http://blog.trackduck.com/2015/01/20/trackduck-helps-tinggly-cope-remote-collaboration/,2015,"We love meeting our clients. Nothing is more rewarding than hearing how your product helps them on a daily basis!This time, we met with a young startup providing a novel solution for presenting unforgettable gifts ‚Äì Tinggly. Although the startup ‚Äì which is in very early stages ‚Äì has already achieved pretty great results, its team members have been scattered around the globe from the very beginning. You could imagine what it‚Äôs like.Below is a record of our conversation that reveals how they‚Äôre doing right now and in what ways the team has coped with the challenges of remote collaboration so far.Tinggly is an absolutely new way of presenting gifts that will definitely be utilized. By buying a gift at Tinggly you present your dear person with a variety of travels and adventures when the person only has to pick where and when to have the best time of his or her life in the period of even two years. Tinggly has to offer hundreds of unique handpicked gifts across more than 80 countries.So if you have also noticed that there are just too many mundane stuff around you, check out Tinggly to make people around you happy at Christmas, on birthdays or on any other special occasions.Yes of course! Our team members are distributed and work in separate offices, different countries and even different continents. Time zones is hard to deal with sometimes, but this is natural, we cannot change it. We build a global gift solution therefore we need to work with people from around the world.We have to focus on keeping everyone on the same page while at the same time balancing time spent on catch-ups, writing and reading reports. At first we thought that tools such as Skype or Asana will satisfy every need we‚Äôd have while working remotely. Though, what we saw later is that the right people are the key to making everything work..We use TrackDuck for internal feedback on our website. We put and group ideas, suggestions and changes that have to be made on our Tinggly web page in order to present our product more attractively. TrackDuck helps to manage things quicker and easier since you get instant feedback on details that have to be improved.For us the best feature of TrackDuck is that you can spot a specific area on a website and add comments. Others can respond to them and in this way a problem gets solved quickly. You don‚Äôt have to write long emails, make screenshots and so on and so forth.It‚Äôs better to see once than to read a hundred times and that‚Äôs true. So this is just exactly what TrackDuck does.No, we haven‚Äôt yet. At the moment we are using Asana for team tasks and planning which works very fine for us. It has not yet replaced email as they claim it should, though we expect that one day it will.The¬†most important thing for us is the clarity of internal processes. This covers a lot: understanding and performing roles, defining and assigning tasks, taking responsibilities, establishing trust, etc. If any unclarity exists, this might lead to miscommunications, waste of time, disappointments and so on. We have to do the opposite ‚Äì communicate, follow up, be transparent give and receive feedback and in this way develop our team and product. As I‚Äôve said, necessary tools help a lot, though the rest relies on people, attitude and of course hard work.If you are working in a remote team, give¬†TrackDuck¬†a try.

365,10317301,Prepaid and Cheap Sim Card Options in Japan for Travelers,http://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/,2015,"by Ryo SevenThere‚Äôs that moment when you land in Japan for the first time, get through the baggage claim and and ride the train into the big city. Maybe you stand in Shibuya crossing delaying traffic, or ¬†pointing at a random photo on a menu, hoping the waiter gets what you‚Äôre trying to order. And when it arrives, the first thing you think is ‚ÄúI need to post this to make my friends envious.‚Äù Alas, you have no data because it costs more than your rent to post a status containing a single emoji. Well fear not, fellow Cheapo, help is at hand!Firstly, you may have noticed that if you wander into a SoftBank or DoCoMo store with your iPhone you‚Äôve brought with you, they‚Äôre not willing to sell you a SIM for it. The official reason is something to do with worldwide mastermind criminal networks communicating to each other exclusively through Japanese phone networks and not at all anything to do with wanting to lock you into a 24-month contract, charging you a trillion million yen for the privilege and then making your life hell for two years with substandard services. Not to mention that even if you were rich and stupid enough to do this on a holiday, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do so as it requires Japanese residential status. Take that, criminals!Learn about these hidden gems, grubby and delicious - drinking and eating like a local in TokyoThis is where MVNO SIMs save the day. MVNO, which stands for ‚ÄúGoogle it, please‚Äù, is your path to getting online in Japan. They‚Äôre not strictly their own carriers, like Verizon or Virgin Mobile, but they are using networks in Japan, like DoCoMo and Au.For the purposes of this article, it‚Äôs not really worth pointing out individual SIM card deals as these change every day, but pointing out a few companies that might be of use. That‚Äôs in case you‚Äôre reading this in the year 3000, where Tokyo Cheapo is second only to Google on your brain-based web browser (but for some reason you still need a SIM card).Note: Before we start, I cannot stress enough that for most of these SIMs, you must have an unlocked phone. And, while Android-based phones seem to be ok from experience, a lot of these seem to be more iOS device friendly for some reason. Regardless, your phone should be Another thing, you might want to check what format of SIM you need. This should be listed on your phone manufacturer‚Äôs page. If you really can‚Äôt work it out, your local phone shop should be able to help you with that. Try to get this info before you set off.What may be for a limited time, Saitama Prefecture is offering free 3-gigabyte SIM cards to foreign tourists that are to be used within 30 days. All you have to do to get your hands on this cheapo delight is visit Saitama via a tour group or spend a night at one of the following hotels.One thing to keep in mind though is the cost of traveling to Saitama (just north of Tokyo Prefecture) and staying at one of these hotels versus the price of just buying a SIM card. If you‚Äôre sticking around the Tokyo¬† area for awhile or were planning to visit Saitama anyways, make your way there at the beginning of your trip so the free SIM is worthwhile. If you‚Äôre only in Tokyo for a few days or a week, you might be better off just paying for a SIM and not losing a day out of the city (no shade to Saitama).If you have any inquiries, you can contact Saitama‚Äôs Tourism Division by email at kanko-kokusai@city.saitama.lg.jp or by phone at +81-48-829-1365.That‚Äôs fine, you can now set yourself up the second you land at an airport (well, at least after you clear customs). U-Mobile, Japan Travel SIM, B-Mobile and Ninja SIM (more on the last two in a bit) have got you covered. U-Mobile has a vending machine installed at Narita Airport for those who want the authentic stereotypical ‚Äúyou can buy everything in vending machines here!!!‚Äù experience, which look a bit like this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and come in 7-day and 15-day versions. At the time of writing, they are limited to a certain amount per day of high speed data, after which it drops to 200 kbps (aka: SLOW) until midnight.You may have also spotted these guys at the nearest convenience store once you‚Äôre in the Arrivals hall.The Japan Travel SIM, a new service from an emerging MVNO giant, IIJmio (I‚Äôm not even going to bother with that acronym) offers a pre-paid service‚Äîthe difference being it lasts for 1-3 months depending on your package. Better for the slightly longer duration traveller, but also for a short-term heavy user as the data can be up to 2GB, which might be useful for those hammering Skype every few minutes. The packaging also opens up to an idyllic Japanese scene, the likes of which you will never actually see in Japan.For the slightly more prepared, B-MobileIf you would prefer an extra 16 days to use your phone for a marginally higher price, another option is Ninja SIM by Biglobe. Like B-Mobile, they have both airport pick up and hotel delivery options.  The sites in the links above are in English, and activation and instructions are also in English. What more do you need?Do be aware of one thing. These are usually data-only SIMs, meaning you can‚Äôt call or text or even receive phone calls. Although, if you‚Äôre still doing that you‚Äôre probably one of those people who prints out emails and puts them in a filing cabinet.No worries. Look for a Bic Camera (Shibuya and Shinjuku have a few) or Yodobashi Camera in Akihabara, (the Electric Town) and grab yourself a plethora of SIMs, which will look like this‚Ä¶The ones that best serve the English-speaking language market are BMobile and OCN.Once you‚Äôre in the shop, say to the staff :We are looking for Sim card. What&#39;s fit to me?Shimu ka-do wo sagishiteimasu. Watashi ni aou no wa do re desu ka?‚Ä¶and that should lead you to the area above. Oh yeah, and you can probably say it in English as well.As you can tell, some of these aren‚Äôt necessarily for the traveler, which brings me to‚Ä¶OK, now you get to play with the cool kids for real. BIC SIM, IIJmio B Mobile and DMM have this covered extremely well. If you‚Äôre going to be in Japan for a while, for example for a full holiday or working holiday visa, you should seriously consider these options, particularly if you have an unlocked phone. BIC SIM have in-store support, so I am going to focus a little more on them, but don‚Äôt let that bias you. Pretty much all of these are better than the huge monopolies that have previously financially crippled users here.Being an MVNO, you don‚Äôt have to be locked into huge long contracts and you can cancel within the month if you‚Äôre not digging the service or coverage in your area. I‚Äôm taking an average campaign price here, but if you compare 2,500 yen for 10GB of 4G data a month, as well as a set amount of Voice and SMS, compared to, say, SoftBank‚Äôs offering of 7,000 yen a month for less data, you can see why one may be inclined to use an MVNO.Once you get the SIM you should get a number attached to it. Simply pop it in your phone (make sure you get the right sized SIM!) and you should in most cases, be able to set up on your phone. The monthly contracts require credit cards or a bank account, so have that information at hand. You can cancel online and while the sites are in Japanese, you can use Google Translate on Chrome to translate the whole site!If you‚Äôre playing the field and checking various MVNO‚Äôs, remember to request an MNP. This will allow you to move your number between services, for the one relative that still insists on calling you on the phone.It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that if you‚Äôre going to stay in a place where you know the address beforehand (e.g. friends, family etc) you can order a lot of these directly from Amazon.co.jp and have them ready to go when you arrive. Some of these do need to be activated from a landline or a Japanese phone, but you can use a payphone in most cases. BIC SIM can be activated in store for you, which makes it even easier!Not at all! You can be super cheap about data and use free wifi from teH eVil Corporations. First up, Starbucks, a coffee chain which I understand is quite popular with the kids, has free wifi, providing you register in advance at the link above. Then, just pop into a store and away you go!OK, well, the richest company on Earth, Apple, happens to give out free wifi at various store locations with no login needed. And if there‚Äôs not one of those near you, the good ol‚Äô Tokyo Metro provides free wifi.AND if your home internet provider is part of the FON network, you can use your own home internet login and passcode on a FON hotspot, which are practically everywhere in Tokyo.That‚Äôs not taking into account cafes and restaurants which also offer free wifi.It is worth pointing out a few other alternative solutions.First up, if you have more than one device that requires the net, or a few of you are travelling together, you may want to consider a portable wi-fi device from a rental provider like these from Japan Wireless or Japan Experience. Rates can be as little as 500 400 yen a day, which, when shared between a few people is quite cheap. You can pick them up and drop them off at airports for convenience and they appear, from the ones I‚Äôve seen so far, to have unlimited or very generous data allowances.AND FINALLY you may be pleased to know that a lot of mobile networks outside Japan are offering cheap roaming packages. For example, dSo what are you waiting for? Get on that plane andSOFTBANK DATA ALLOWANCE EXCEEDED. Please pay ¬•8,000,000 to continue.‚ÄúAlthough, if you‚Äôre still doing that you‚Äôre probably one of those people who prints out emails and puts them in a filing cabinet.‚Äù Well slightly long term visitors might need a traditional phone number for education/business/restaurant reservation etc. I am happily using OCN Mobile One with calling and sms service, for only 1600 yen per month.You can circumvent it by taking an ip number in 050. It works pretty well and is accepted almost everywhere.So useful! Thanks!Thanks a lot for this amazing article! I wish I had read it before going to Softbank last year. I went there wanting to buy one of those cheap prepaid phones they used to sell, but got told that they were ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù. Then I was tricked into applying for a 2-year, 7000yen/month contract just to get a smartphone that I could use in Japan (mine was locked). I was told that it was their cheapest contract‚Ä¶.
Anyway, my previous stupidity aside, I would like to point out one tiny thing.
To have access to the sim cards in this article, you need an unlocked phone.  In some countries (ie France), almost nobody has a unlocked phone because we get them through phone network companies and they only sell you locked phones.
So if you‚Äôre a French person in Japan and you want to follow this article advice, you need to order a new, unlocked phone on Amazon. These are quite expensive‚Ä¶ the lowest price for a new smartphone is 70 euros..What about renting a mi-fi unit? That‚Äôs what we did on our last trip to Tokyo. Rented 2 mi-fi‚Äôs and figured each person would pair up with another. Was able to upload to social media. Used Google Hangouts for calls and messages. Worked great.Thanks for this.  Has anyone found an appreciable difference in speed or other features between these options?Hi Ryo!
Thanks for the informative article. I just have one question: What about us REAL Cheapos with nothing but rarely used flip phones (a few phone calls and texts a week). Is there a SIM card you can recommend for such nonsense!
Thanks for your time.Howdy RealCheap! Sorry for the delay in responding! It all depends. If you‚Äôre living here, I strongly recommend a Docomo FOMA contract, which will set you back around 2000 yen a month but is generous with it‚Äôs voice offerings if your family is also on docomo (i.e. free unlimited calls to other docomos). I haven‚Äôt used this personally, so you may need to purchase a phone with the contract.  I can‚Äôt quite tell if you‚Äôre a tourist or not, but if not, you may want to consider b-mobiles http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/kd/plan.html lineup. They have cheap monthly plans for about ¬•1290 a month. They don‚Äôt usually set these up for travellers, but a friend here might be able to sort out a month or two for you and cancel at the end. You can just order the SIM in this case. Hope that helps!I‚Äôm moving back to Japan in a couple of months. To anyone stubborn enough to ignore the great advice of this article, do not, I repeat, do not get Softbank or Docomo (although Docomo is the superior option between the two). If you really have to get yourself into an unnecessary phone plan because you really want that new Xperia or iPhone 17S+ Rose Gold SE, go to AU. And if you‚Äôre less inclined to participate in the phone wars, Y! Mobile and Willcomm aren‚Äôt terrible options either.Hi Brandon, Thanks for the comment ‚Äì although I must heartily disagree! AU is as bad as Softbank and Docomo.  They use exactly the same anti-competitive practices. Also, Y!Mobile is a subsidiary of Softbank ‚Äì so the same goes for them. Your mileage may vary, but just about every MVNO in our article on the subject has better contract terms than the big carriers. https://tokyocheapo.com/business/japan-sim-card-options-data-voice/Thanks for clearing that up, Greg. I‚Äôve been duped for years then. I‚Äôll know better when I return in a couple of months. Thank goodness I have an unlocked phone these days.No worries! You caught me when I was feeling particularly sore about AU because I had to cancel a ‚Äúkodomo keitai‚Äù contract with AU last week because said phone went through the washing machine. They charged me 10,250yen to cancel the contract ‚Äì more than 2 years were up but it had automatically renewed so they charged me the full cancellation fee.I always believed AU was the ‚Äúlesser of all evils‚Äù when it came to the big contracts. That‚Äôs awful that they put you through the ringer like that! Big phone companies always seem to take advantage of their most loyal customers. It never made sense to me. We don‚Äôt ask for much; reasonable amounts of data at reasonable prices without hidden fees and ghost charges. I‚Äôm so glad I stumbled upon TC. I‚Äôm not new to living in Japan but I‚Äôll certainly be a deer-in-headlights because I‚Äôm new to living in Tokyo.Omg I agree so much tho, when I first got in Tokyo I got a contract immediately with SoftBank to get an iPhone and regretted it pretty much the whole time after that lolAre there any of these MVNO SIM cards that don‚Äôt require a Japanese credit card? I tried to get one at BIC that was month to month but you needed a Japanese credit card which is a whole other issue‚Ä¶Are you sure? i got a SIM at Bic Camera just last week with a Hong Kong issued Mastercard. No problem at all.  They might tell you that you need a Japan issued credit card, but just ask them to see if they can process the transaction. For the record, I got a Freetel SIM.Provided that I am resident of Japan is it possible to buy a voice SIM card without any credit card? I don‚Äôt want any contract, I‚Äôd prefer pay-as-you-go solution where I could just top up in a store or online.Hmmm bit of a tough one. Some packages DO allow direct bank transfers online. Is that what you meant by topping up online?You actually won‚Äôt have any problems as you can just recharge at the actual stores or convience stores etc. but honestly you should get a credit card on the go asap lol. Once you have your resident card you can legally obtain a local SIM card with a number, and voice functions. Otherwise if a non resident wants a voice sim then SoftBank and B mobile are now offering voice sims.Hi Ryo, thanks for the information. Do you know if you can get a MVNO sim card on a tourists visa? I will be looking for work and have a bank account from when I was in Japan last(never closed it). I was reading the information on the BIC site and it says you will need proof of identification. In my case I would only have my passportHowdy Bryan!I believe you can get one from B-Mobile without a long term visa.  Yodobashi camera should be able to help you with that one üôÇThanks for writing!‚ÄúThese are usually data-only sims, meaning you can‚Äôt call or text or even receive phone calls. Although, if you‚Äôre still doing that you‚Äôre probably one of those people  who prints out emails and puts them in a filing cabinet.‚ÄùWhat an imbecilic thing to say. Negates anything useful in the article.  So, we are to assume that the author no longer calls anyone or receives any calls? How lovely. I suppose in emergencies, you also rely on email or Skype to get help, to call an ambulance or the police or the fire department? Great tip, champ. Rely 100% on the internet for all of your needs. Brilliant. Fact: People do use phones for making telephone calls. What a surprise! Especially people who have real real jobs. In addition to that foolish assertion, there are lots of other bits of misguided information in this so-called guide. I‚Äôll be sure to warn others away from tokyocheapo from now on.Wow ‚Äì Victor, I haven‚Äôt seen your article on this topic, but it must be really incredible as only someone with such insight into the Japanese telecoms market could ever justify being so snide. You should have the good grace to accept that the author was focussing on people that use data for *all* forms of communication, and base your opinion on that.  The author was *helpfully* pointing out that these sims are for data only, and suggesting there are plenty of VOIP services out there that allow you to make calls. Victor, I suggest that when you visit Japan you turn on data roaming, and spend 4 hours on the phone wishing old Granny Laszlo (yes I know that‚Äôs not your real name)  a happy Birthday, because, you know, telephone calls in Japan are *really* cheap, especially when calling overseas. I look forward to seeing your reaction when you get home and open the bill.Hi Vic! (Hope you don‚Äôt mind me calling you Vic!),I‚Äôm sorry the article didn‚Äôt reach your standards. We always strive to inform our users based on our experience, so we realise everyone has different needs!Just to clear up a few points of yours, all Japanese data SIMs have emergency calling on them in case you need the ambulance, police and fire services. The police can be called on 110 and the other two services can be reached on 119. (Luckily, I haven‚Äôt had to use them yet, touch wood!) Also, just in case you didn‚Äôt know, Skype can be used for emergency calling in Australia, Denmark, Finland and the U.K., if you ever visit any of those wonderful countries!If you were to use an overseas phone in Japan, you‚Äôd be able to do emergency calling on that for free! Regarding the other ‚Äúbits of misguided information‚Äù you refer to, can you let me know which parts these are? We do always strive to keep our information accurate on the site, so if anything else needs explaining, let me know!I‚Äôm also incredibly sorry to inform you that on this occasion, your assumption mentioned in your comment was, sadly, incorrect. My workplace uses iPhones, so we‚Äôve been using FaceTime audio for all calls and WebEx for group calls since 2009, in order to save a large amount of money (which goes towards our bonuses!) For my family, I personally use FaceTime and LINE to communicate with the ones that don‚Äôt live with me. For my wife, I tend to use the ‚Äúreal FaceTime‚Äù, aka talking! (Haha)!However, now I think about it, all of those are VoIP services, so you were right! I don‚Äôt ‚Äúuse the phone‚Äù and no one ‚Äúcalls‚Äù me (Haha)!Do write back and let me know about your job. It sounds fascinating! It sounds like you use the phone a lot. Are you in the call centre industry or finance, maybe? This isn‚Äôt my full time job (someday, I hope, haha!) but at the moment I work in the field of industrial design engineering for radiology equipment, mainly focusing on thin slice reconstruction for CT and MRI machines and implementation new imaging technology in order to speed up volumetric reconstructions for radiologists to perform diagnoses on (sounds boring, I know!) This job requires three telephone conferences between three countries a week! (phew!) We use WebEx for this and not only can we hear our co-workers, we can see them too using video calling!So, thanks for taking the time to write and hope to hear from you soon! All the best,RyoDo you live in Asia? Man I can‚Äôt remember the last time I made a phone call. Not a phone call in the sense of talking to someone but LINE is actually so integrated with every aspect of life even where I‚Äôm Living in Taiwan now, speak to my classmates, my boss my parents , landlord everyone has LINE. So I‚Äôm not really sure what your getting at but he‚Äôs suggesting sims for tourists in Japan. Having data does not at all limit YOUR ability to make phone calls, you can actually make more now as well as with video. Welcome to 2017 budHi Ryo. Good info. I‚Äôm planning to get a data sim card during my short trip to Japan this Dec. But I‚Äôm not sure my iPhone6 is unlock or notHowdy Razuwa!
The easiest way is to get a friend who is on a different network to give you their SIM card for a bit. Eject the one from the tray using a paper clip and try theirs. If it connects without any fuss, you‚Äôre good to go! If you‚Äôre struggling to find anyone on a different network, go to your nearest phone store and ask for the cheapest pay as you go sim for a different network to the one you are on. If it doesn‚Äôt work then you won‚Äôt have wasted too much cash. hello‚Ä¶i came to japan last week and i need to get a sim which has both data and voice call function. I have a bank account .But i do not have credit card and it will take 3 three weeks for the card to get issued.
Is ther any MNVO which gives connection with bank account and with no credit card.??? AU and softbank gives connection but i don`t want to pay so much money for that.please help.
Thanks in advanceThere‚Äôs a discussion about this on our community -> https://community.tokyocheapo.com/t/data-sim-without-any-credit-card-whatsoever/512/3Hey Ryo,Awesome article, just a few follow up questions.I will be moving to Japan soon for work for an extended period.  This requires me to open a Bank account.  To open a Bank account I need a phone number, but to get one of these sims I need a bank account.  How should I proceed? And do the Data only sims cards come with a phone number attached to them (required for Bank account)?ThanksOmg, it‚Äôs Japan. Your not going to find a spot where you wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a SIM card. Even in 7/11 you can find them. And to open a bank account your going to need more then a phone number your going to need visas paperwork etc etc. I moved to JP at 18 and literally had this stuff planned out so long before I arrived, get to work.This guys a dick^^^It‚Äôs a while since I opened a bank account but if that‚Äôs an issue, one work around would be getting VOIP number or ‚ÄúSkype in‚Äù number for Japan. You can use that as a (perhaps temporary) phone number for opening a bank account.‚Äì for crying out loud, how stinking complicated can they make it to obtain simple cell service ??  japan is light years ahead on the technology side but primitive on the service infrastructure; data plan with ABC, cell service with XYZ, limits on minutes used, contracts, gaijin cards, etc..  the company that first adopts the simple all inclusive pre-paid plan will clean house in japan. register your sim, enter your visa number and your off to the races.  ..jeeeez.I recommend GTN mobile. they are cheap, have several language support and a small shop in Shin-Okubo. I made sure their SIM works with my phone before I signed the contract in their office in Shin-Okubo. you don‚Äôt need a credit card or bank account because they also offer a conbini-payment option. I am also a GTN mobile user. They are very friendly for foreigners (good english and met in person to install my sim card and make sure it works), although they are lil bit more expensive than some of the other sim card services or data only.
Speaking of which I just had a very frustrating day in Osaka, trying to switch to another sim card service for the better prices. I went to two BIC locations and a yamata denki to get a sim card and no one would sell me a sim card, instead trying to convince me that I had to buy a new Japanese phone or mobile hotspot or prepaid sim. Talked to 5 different sales people. They were all convinced that there was no way my phone could work with a Japanese SIM. So I ended up calling up GTN and continuing their service..
 I showed sales people the frequencies (bands) my phone could receive and the bands of the major Japanese cellphone services (they are the same) and they didn‚Äôt know anything about it and continued to be unhelpful. I felt that this was mostly because I was a foreigner (cellphone sale commission?).  So just a warning to those‚Ä¶maybe ordering a sim on amazon would be better. I do have a friend who did get a very cheap sim contract from Bic for his Canadian phone tho.I had a similar experience to you as well. I was on b-mobile last year and decided i wanted to change to iijmio as it was cheaper so I went to BIC Camera so I could also get the free wifi membership. Once I got there they kept insisting that I needed to buy a ‚Äújapanese phone‚Äù and that the sim wouldn‚Äôt work on my current ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù phone even though I had been using b-mobile sim for the past year!! After I got really angry, they conceded and finally sold the sim to me though.Sad to hear. I also have a friend who got a sim from them by getting angry. Seems to be the only way :/ This is clearly discrimination. What can you do?I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs discrimination. I think they‚Äôve been instructed that overseas phones don‚Äôt have the right radio bands and they don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the returns. Many years ago I had the same problem trying to buy generic RAM chips from BIC. When I told them It was for a Toshiba laptop, they told me I couldn‚Äôt buy generic and refused to sell It to me! I‚Äôd suggest just buying the SIM without showing them your handset.Haha maybe they have been yelled at by too many foreigners for selling them sim cards that don‚Äôt work. So now they won‚Äôt sell us sim card until we yell at them more than the previous customer who yelled at them for selling them a sim..
Joking aside, why don‚Äôt they just ask me about what cell phone bands my phone can receive. Why don‚Äôt they advertise the cell bands that their sims do work on? They are supposed to be the experts. Why did they only try and push more expensive options on me?
I have felt coerced by all the Japanese mobile sales people, besides GTN, to buy more expensive and unnecessary options and people should be aware that they are very cheap sim options available and that they work with pretty much all phones made within the last couple years.

366,10269030,iOS 9 Hack: How to Access Private Photos and Contacts Without a Passcode,http://thehackernews.com/2015/09/io9-hack-passcode.html,2015,"








 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 






Setting a passcode on your iPhone is the first line of defense to help prevent other people from accessing your device. 



However, it's pretty easy for anyone to access your personal photographs and contacts from your iPhone running iOS 9 in just 30 seconds or less, even with a passcode and/or Touch ID enabled.


Just yesterday, the Security firm Zerodium announced a Huge Bug Bounty of 1 Million Dollars for finding out zero-day exploits and jailbreak for iPhones and iPads running iOS 9. Now...


A hacker has found a new and quite simple method of bypassing the security of a locked iOS device (iPhone, iPad or iPod touch) running Apple's latest iOS 9 operating system that could allow you to access the device's photos and contacts in 30 seconds or less.



Yes, the passcode on any iOS device running iOS 9.0 is possible to bypass using the benevolent nature of Apple‚Äôs personal assistant Siri.



Here's the List of Steps to Bypass Passcode:



You need to follow these simple steps to bypass passcode on any iOS device running iOS 9.0:



Wake the iOS device and Enter an incorrect passcode four times.
For the fifth time, Enter 3 or 5 digits (depending on how long your passcode is), and for the last one, press and hold the Home button to invoke Siri immediately followed by the 4th digit.
After Siri appears, ask her for the time.
Tap the Clock icon to open the Clock app, and add a new Clock, then write anything in the Choose a City field.
Now double tap on the word you wrote to invoke the copy & paste menu, Select All and then click on ""Share"".
Tap the 'Message' icon in the Share Sheet, and again type something random, hit Return and double tap on the contact name on the top.
Select ""Create New Contact,"" and Tap on ""Add Photo"" and then on ""Choose Photo"".
You'll now be able to see the entire photo library on the iOS device, which is still locked with a passcode. Now browse and view any photo from the Photo album individually.



Video Demonstration¬†



You can also watch a video demonstration (given below) that shows the whole hack in action. 



It isn't a remote flaw you need to worry about, as this only works if someone has access to your iPhone or iOS device. However, such an easy way to bypass any locked iOS device could put users personal data at risk.



How to Prevent iOS 9 Hack



Until Apple fixes this issue, iOS users can protect themselves by disabling Siri on the lock screen from Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. Once disabled, you‚Äôll only be able to use Siri after you have unlocked your iOS device using the passcode or your fingerprint.

367,6669001,How to kill Java with a Regular Expression,http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/09/how-to-kill-java-with-a-regular-expression.html,2013," Posted by:  Andreas Haufler  in  Core Java September 27th, 2013We recently stumbled upon a phenomen we absolutely weren‚Äôt aware of: You can kill any Java IDE and also any Java process with a simple regular expression‚Ä¶Back in university, I was taught that regular expressions, which are called regular grammers or type 3 grammers¬† always end up in an finite state automaton and can therefore be processed in linear time (input length doubles, processing time doubles). However, that‚Äôs only true for ‚Äúsane‚Äù expressions. A regular expression can also result in an non-deterministic finite state automaton and things can get messed up quite bad.Consider the expression: (0*)*A¬† This will any number of zeros, followed by an upper case A. Now if you use Matcher.find() for this expression, everything is fine as long as there is a match in the input. However, if you call this, with ‚Äù 00000000000000000000‚Ä≥ as input, your program will hang (and so will the regex console in Eclipse or IntelliJ and every (Java-based) online regex service).What at first glance looks like an infinite loop, truns out to be catastrophic backtracking. What this basically means is, that the matcher detects, that no A was found at the end of the input. Now the outer quantifier goes on step back ‚Äì the inner one forward and again ‚Äì no result. Therefore the matcher goes back step by step retrying all combinations to find a match. It will eventually return (without a match) but the complexity (and therefore the runtime) of this is expotential (adding one character to the input doubles the runtime). A detailed description can be found here: catastrophic backtrackingHere are some runtimes I measured (which almost exactly double for each character added):As a little side-note: For micro benchmarks like this, you always need to ‚Äúwarm‚Äù up the JVM as the HotSpot JIT will jump in at some point and optimize the code. Therefore the first run looks like this:So what‚Äôs the take-away here? If you‚Äôre running a server application or anything critical used by many users, don‚Äôt let them enter regular expressions unless you really trust them. There are regex implementations out there, which detect this problem and abort, but Java (up to JDK 8) doesn‚Äôt.Note: You can test this with your local IDE or a small Java program to your hearts content ‚Äì but please don‚Äôt start to knock out all the regex tester websites out there. Those guys provide a nice tool free of charge, so it would be quite unfair..Here is the tiny benchmark I used:¬†¬†¬†¬† Email address:  ¬†  Email address:  ¬†  Email address:  ¬†fyi: http://madbean.com/2004/mb2004-20/another Java Regex ‚Äúfeature‚Äù ;)Yes, this is known problem with anything that can be treated like ‚Äúprogram code‚Äù. And the RegEx pattern literal certanly is. ButA) IntelliJ IDEA won‚Äôt hang on this ‚Äì and most likely on any ‚Äì regular expression used in its ‚Äúfind‚Äù. And not because of multithreading or something. We just won‚Äôt let the evaluating thread to hang.B) There is a totally generic solution that allows this ‚Äì if you think of the problem root.The problem root is that you loosing execution control whenever you invoke any lib function. And the more complex its code is the more likely you can get unexpected behaviour on arbitrary input. Most likely (and its true for java regex lib) the only point where you can still easily control this 3rd party code is the access to the input data.In this case wrapping input in custom delegating CharSequence will allow you to abort the execution based on execution timing or any other condition.I agree with the take-away and I think it fits in the more general approach of not ‚Äútrusting‚Äù any user input.Looking at the benchmark code, the issue there is mainly the use of greedy quantifiers. Using possessive quantifiers could prevent this behavior: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.htmlHey Andreas, This is very interesting. Thanks a lot for sharing it and it‚Äôs a good thing you mentioned about not testing this code online.Even after using Regex for quite some time it‚Äôs only recently that I discovered catastrophic backtracking. In my case it broke one batch processor:http://vladmihalcea.com/2014/02/24/the-regex-that-broke-a-server/I don‚Äôt understand why matcher continues when it doesn‚Äôt find ‚ÄòA‚Äô character in the end of the stringjmzc, the pattern evaluator doesn‚Äôt keep track of what it‚Äôs already processed. so it sees that there‚Äôs no A at the end, but it doesn‚Äôt know if there was an earlier A that was greedily consumed. thus it backtracks to the last wildcard and tries a shorter match. once again there is no A, so it backtracks again and tries a shorter match, etc., without ever figuring out how pointless this is.Your email address will not be published.

372,9414268,Aspose.Cells for Java API 8.4.1 Released,http://goo.gl/PmbSdq,2015,"We are pleased to announce the monthly release of Aspose.Cells for Java, version 8.4.1. This release contains many useful features & enhancements that you may start exploring immediately, however, before you head to the download section here is a look at just a few of the worth mentioning features in this month‚Äôs release. For a full list of bug fixes and improvements please refer to the download page in the link above. In case you are planning to upgrade the API from any previous revision, we strongly suggest you to go through the Public API Changes section first to know what has been changed since your current version of the API.Starting with this release, Aspose.Cells for Java has dropped the support for Java versions prior to v6 and has moved its codebase to Java 6 (Java 7 and 8 are also supported). Reason being, Sun/Oracle has discontinued the support for all JDK revisions prior to 1.6. Now the Aspose.Cells for Java package contains a single Jar that works well with Java 6, 7 & 8.Microsoft Excel application allows to create the database connection so that the data could be fetched and loaded in the spreadsheets to refresh Pivot Tables, Charts or just the worksheet. The external data source is connected to the workbook through a data connection, which is a set of information that describes how to locate, log in, query, and access the external data source.Aspose.Cells for Java API does not allow to create a database connection yet, however, some revisions back, the API had exposed the ExternalConnection class that contains the method & properties that could be used to inspect the database connection details stored in a spreadsheet. Most of the properties associated with ExternalConnection class were read-only until the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 8.4.1. With this release, the API has provided the support to manipulate the database connection settings. Please check the detailed article on Modify Existing Database Connection Settings.Another worth mentioning feature is the support for setting desired image dimensions while exporting spreadsheets & charts to image formats. Aspose.Cells for Java 8.4.1 has exposed the ImageOrPrintOptions.setDesiredSize method to set the dimensions of the resultant image while exporting spreadsheets & charts to images. The setDesiredSize method accepts two integer type parameters, where first is the desired width and second parameter is the desired height.The following code snippet shows how to set the desired dimensions while exporting Worksheet to PNG. Please note, similar mechanism can also be used to set the image dimensions while converting Charts to image formats.Microsoft Excel has predefined settings to render comments while printing the spreadsheet or saving them in PDF format. Aspose.Cells APIs have borrowed this concept from Microsoft Excel and have exposed the PageSetup.PrintComments property & PrintCommentsType enumeration to facilitate the rendering of comments while converting spreadsheets to PDF format. The PrintCommentsType enumeration has the following constants that behave similarly as of Microsoft Excel application.The API has recently exposed the DataLabels.characters method to retrieve an instance of FontSetting class that corresponds to the sub-string of a ChartPoints.DataLabels. In turn, the instance of FontSetting class can be used to format the sub-string of the Data Labels with different font settings & color.The following code snippet shows how to use the DataLabels.characters method.Aspose.Cells for Java 8.4.1 has exposed the Workbook.isLicensed which could be of great help in determining if the license has been successfully loaded or not. If you access this property before setting the license, it will return false and true for a properly set valid license.The following sample code demonstrates the usage of Workbook.isLicensed property.Aspose.Cells for Java 8.4.1 has fixed a number of issues and enhanced the core to accommodate many customer requested features. Following are a few worth mentioning enhancements & fixes.Please visit the documentation for details, and if you still have any questions, we always welcome inquiries on Aspose.Cells Support Forum.No related posts.

They started by referring to themselves as a ‚Äúcustomer focused airline‚Äù.The rest was a canned response explaining that all airlines overbook flights to cover the ‚Äúno show factor‚Äù. It didn't say anything about the fact Etihad had overbooked it so they could charge for more seats than were physically on the plane.They offered me 10,000 miles from their rewards store, which after I sign up I can exchange for a travel adapter or I can add a little money and get the Shirt Carrier Plus!Etihad don't give your money back if you don‚Äôt show up to your flight, so why should passengers take the hit when Etihad overbook the flight they have bought? It can only benefit Etihad. If all the passengers show up to the flight, which they've paid for, they just kick some people off to the next one, and give them a huge runaround.They do give you a useless US$300 voucher and enough points to buy a travel adapter though.This is not a ‚Äúcustomer focused airline‚Äù. Don‚Äôt fly Etihad Airways.Update 1 (10/2/2015): Etihad have contacted me through facebook asking to Private Message them my ticket number and email address.I sent them a direct message with the requested information and a link to this post. I then received this response from them telling me to send it to an email address.Am I being handballed around again? Is this a downward cyber spiral? Should I just give up? Stay tuned for an update‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt Fly Etihad AirwaysI am a very experienced traveller and very easy going when it comes to flying. I've always found it funny when people complain about delays, airline food, crying babies, the on-board wifi not being fast enough, leg room, fat people, the list of topics goes on. I'm not fussed about any of that. I get on, chill out, fall asleep, thank the flight staff on the way out. Easy.This experience though‚Ä¶I recently had to fly home to Melbourne, Australia (MEL) from Berlin, Germany (TXL). I had booked the flight several months before for AU$1750 round trip. Not at all a budget flight, as none are when the destination or origin is within Australia.The first leg was with Air Berlin to Abu Dhabi (AUH). While checking in, the Air Berlin Employee told me he was unable to give me a boarding pass for the AUH‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMEL flight, to which I said I wouldn‚Äôt have time to organise in Abu Dhabi as I only had an hour between the flights. I knew at this stage something was up. He advised me that I would have to take it up with Etihad staff upon arrival in Abu Dhabi. He was as helpful as he could possibly be within his power. I have always had great experiences with Air Berlin, I put them up the top with Virgin as the best airlines I have flown with.After running as fast as possible without knocking people over (but coming close to) through AUH terminals I arrive at the Etihad Transfer Desk. In front of Aruba, perhaps the most incompetent person I've ever dealt with, he advises me that I won't be on the flight because Etihad have overbooked it. It has been overbooked for more than 8 hours. He finishes with ‚ÄúStep aside Sir, I have more people to deal with‚Äù.Another traveller who had also been overbooked, for a different destination, told me that legally Etihad have to pay for any other routes that can get you to your destination quicker than they can. I wasn't sure about this, but he seemed to have been in this situation before.At this stage it was nearing 9:00pm and the last options of getting to Australia that day are getting slim. There was a 10:35pm flight to Sydney and a 10:55pm to Perth. I asked Aruba if there was any possibility of getting on that flight. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù he grunted and dismissed me back to my waiting area with no other information about what is happening.After talking with other Etihad staff about Aruba being so unhelpful in this situation I get my first string of handballing. I think I was handballed through 4 different people this time, all of them responding with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help, go talk to him‚Äù or something similar. None of them taking any accountability. I end up back at the Transfer Desk and it sinks in that I am going to be in Abu Dhabi for the night. I wait at the Transfer Desk longer, letting a couple of people in front of me so I might deal with someone more helpful than Aruba.A seemingly helpful woman apologises for the inconvenience and asks if I would rather wait for the same flight the next day or leave 10 hours before that via Brisbane (BNE) with a 2 hour layover and onto MEL through Virgin Australia, which would get me home quicker. I agree to the Brisbane flight and ask about upgrades, she hands me a US$300 voucher and says ‚ÄúThis can be used for upgrades‚Äù. Etihad put me up in a hotel for the night, with ‚Äúchauffeur service‚Äù. They also gave me an airport meal ticket, just in case I felt like getting Burger King during my impromptu holiday in the UAE.In my frustrated state I didn't notice the Brisbane flight only gets me to Melbourne 2 hours before the same flight would have but leaves 11 hours before. There are hours unaccounted for.I awake in the morning, get crammed into a pre-organised 6 passenger minibus at 8:00am, the time I had been told to be ready by. I share the minibus with a German family of four, two kids sitting on their parents laps, a middle-aged NZ lady, and a German chick and English dude both in their 20s. It was a tight squeeze. I wondered if this could still be described as ‚Äúchauffeur service‚Äù, maybe the term just seemed luxurious in my head.We get to the airport around 8:40am for the 10:00am flight. There is no time to seek the upgrade at the Etihad check-in counter, I head to the gate hoping to do it there. After clearing security, I look at the departure board to see my Brisbane flight alternating text with ‚ÄúBRISBANE‚Äù and ‚ÄúSINGAPORE‚Äù.At the gate I ask what is going on and explain ‚ÄúI was told this is a direct flight to Brisbane‚Äù to which I get the response ‚ÄúIt is a direct flight to Brisbane‚Ä¶ via Singapore‚Äù. I'm a bit bewildered by that statement and pretty pissed off I wasn't told that the night before during the re-issue. The guy at the gate explains further ‚ÄúYou will stop in Singapore for a very short time, some people will get off, you will stay on the plane then you will take off again‚ÄùOK, so this is going to be a little bit of a headache. Instead of my original 14 hour direct and overbooked flight that I had booked several months in advance, I‚Äôm now taking 3 flights (8 hours, 7 hours, 2 hours) over 21 hours, after a night in a hotel plus the 6 hour flight from Berlin. I‚Äôm going to be in transit for 22 hours longer than planned, to a total of around 42 hours.I show the gate staff my voucher that ‚Äúcan be used for an upgrade‚Äù and now I'm told this voucher can‚Äôt be used for upgrades but it can be used for excess baggage.I ask to talk to the manager, to which my second handballing starts. I explain my situation to at least 2 managers, before asking to see their managers. By this stage, other passengers are lining up to board. People around me have heard me explain my situation to 3 different managers, when the last manager I can fit in before missing this flight arrives to the gate and amongst the crowd of people says ‚ÄúYes Sir, can I help you?‚Äù. I know the intimidation game so I move him away to a quieter area to explain my situation once again while the flight is boarding. As I have no options left at this stage I tell him I want a cash refund and he tells me that Etihad do not do cash refunds, but there is a case by case exception and I should go to the website to make a complaint, he says I have a very good case for it. He adds ‚ÄúYou can even do it via the Facebook page!‚Äù Isn't that just fucking fantastic! All this time dealing with Etihad staff I could've just went on Facebook.He also reminds me that I can even use the voucher for excess baggage on the BNE‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMEL. I explain I only have carry-on and ask him if he really thinks I am going to get to Brisbane and buy a heap of stuff just to use the voucher on excess baggage. He agrees that the voucher has been rendered useless to me for this trip.Upon landing in Singapore, the Captain announces that we will be stopping for 2 hours, everyone will have to get off the plane, but we won't have to go through security again. Of course, when we get off the gate has changed, we are directed back through security, a process that took around 90 minutes. We board the plane again and head for Brisbane.In Brisbane, Virgin Australia put me on a flight an hour earlier to Melbourne. This is the best thing that has happened in the past 40 hours. Thanks Virgin.I made it to Melbourne. 2 and a half weeks later I have to fly back to Berlin, again with Etihad.I check in online and choose my seat for both flights MEL‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAUH and AUH‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTXL. Brilliant! There is no way I can get overbooked for this flight. I arrive at the airport, clear security and immigration with about 40 minutes until boarding time. I start walking towards the gate and hear ‚ÄúPatrick O‚ÄôMeara for Etihad flight 461 to Abu Dhabi please make yourself known to Etihad staff‚Äù My favourite people! I run to the gate and talk to a tall guy behind a computer ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very lucky you made it, you nearly lost your seat‚Äù, ‚ÄúLost my seat? I checked in online 12 hours ago, how could I lose my seat?‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou have to go to the check-in desk when you first get to the airport as well‚Äù, ‚ÄúSo what is the use of checking in online then?‚Äù The guy couldn‚Äôt answer my last question. It should be noted here that I only travel with carry-on luggage, a small laptop backpack. They were looking to boot me and get another ticket sale on an already full flight. I told him and another lady that I had a voucher for an upgrade that I would like to use. The lady said ‚ÄúNo problem, just show the attendants when you board the flight‚Äù. Great!I board the flight and let a guy in a white suit know that I have a voucher that ‚Äúcan be used for an upgrade‚Äù, he asks for my original seat number and says he will come and get me after boarding has finished. Boarding finishes and we start taxiing out to the runway, the attendants are doing their final check and I explain to one of the female attendants that I have a voucher and would like to use it for an upgrade. She checks if there is one available, and rushes me to Business Class during take off. I‚Äôve never been in Business Class, the seats are nice. The same lady tells me that the guy in the white suit will be back to finalise the transaction.20 minutes go by and sure enough the guy in the white suit tells me the upgrade will cost AU$984. I tell him I was told by the ground staff and the lady that issued the voucher 3 weeks prior that it could be used for this and he goes to check. There is no chance I am paying the difference of around AU$620 (after a rough conversion) to Etihad Airways, I‚Äôm not paying anything ever again to Etihad Airways. He returns and tells me that the voucher can‚Äôt be used at all for upgrades but it can be used for Duty Free purchases onboard this flight. I tell him I‚Äôm not paying for the upgrade and I return to Economy class with my people. My life as a high roller was short lived.I start to look through the Duty Free onboard magazine but I'm not into Armani, Tommy Hilfiger or just buying shit for the sake of buying it. There is some tech gadgets that I am interested in though. I ask one of the attendants about some of them, she explains that she doesn‚Äôt have any available but she thinks the voucher may be redeemable at the Duty Free in the airport. I doubt it but don‚Äôt say anything to her as she is very nice to me. She goes on to tell me she overheard the conversation I had previously about the Etihad ground staff, and explains to me that it is an ongoing issue within Etihad where the ground staff will promise passengers things and tell them to take it up with the flight staff, only to have the passengers with no options after they have boarded. It has happened to her quite a few times both with passengers to her and when she is off duty as a passenger herself. She is probably the nicest Etihad employee I have dealt with. She also tells me to go to the website and make a complaint. This time I tell her ‚ÄúYou can also do it through the Facebook page!‚Äù She said, she wasn‚Äôt aware of that. I had a chuckle to myself.No surprise the voucher isn‚Äôt redeemable at any of the Duty Free stores in the airport. One of the Salesman told me that it can only be used for flights. Full circle I thought. This magical voucher can be used for flights, upgrades, excess baggage, duty free onboard and duty free in airports‚Ä¶ depending on who you ask.I board the Air Berlin flight to Berlin. It was awesome. A little delayed but they apologised and kept us informed. Thanks Air Berlin.The guy in Abu Dhabi told me to list things in bullet points when I wrote my complaint out on the website to them. So here they are:I recommend that flying with Etihad Airways be a very last resort, change the dates you‚Äôre flying to avoid them. I would without a doubt. They are a headache you don't need.I am back in Berlin now, with my useless US$300 Etihad voucher and my expired Abu Dhabi airport meal ticket.Peace.Web/Mobile Engineer, UX/UI Designer

                                20 February 2015                            
‚ÄòFrom Cool dude to Cancer dud in 10 days flat‚Äô‚ÄúIf you want to make god laugh, tell him about your plans,‚Äù philosophised Woody Allen. But for Rahul Yadav, there was little laughing to be done when tragedy struck. He recounts, ‚ÄúIt was the August of 2013. I was 28 years old and had been doing very well with work where I had just quit HCL Technologies to join Society Generale ‚Äì A French Investment Bank in Bangalore. I had also just tied the knot with my childhood sweetheart. We had moved into a new house and were setting it up.I used to cycle to office (Bangalore is the one city in India where you can do so), was a badminton fanatic and used to play for hours post work. At that time I was keen to buy my first car and also was making big plans to go to Andamans with my wife and parents before my father would retire from the Army. I was just getting started.But then I just fell sick one fine day. It started with a minor cough and cold. Health got worse and I was then suspected and treated for dengue and eventually diagnosed with Cancer.On 23rd of August 2013 I was told that I have Multiple Myeloma, a rare form of Blood Cancer. So from Cool dude to a Cancer dud in 10 days flat.‚ÄùWhen everything came to a standstill‚ÄúThis was a shocker for all. Everything came to standstill,‚Äù says Rahul.While his family was a pillar of strength and support -‚ÄúMy wife and parents and my family and friends were very supportive and calm. They helped me process the diagnosis and gave me the space I needed to accept what was happening. I was comforted by their warmth and support. My wife always had a smile on her face and that kept me going. They say that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only the loved ones who would be there next to you during your tough times‚Äù. It is so true,‚Äù- he needed something more to fight the toughest battle of his life.‚ÄúOne thing that really frustrating was how difficult it was to find people who could empathize with me. Generally people perceive cancer patients as unfortunate souls who are to be pitied (or in some cases, judged). Getting a cancer diagnosis is truly unfortunate but we don't require pity or judgement. What we really need is support to battle this disease. We are fighting an enemy that came unforeseen to us-we need all the strength we can get!Cancer was like an unwanted guest had come over to stay at my house. Not only did he stay but started changing everything thing around me. I could not take up the new job. So was jobless. I had leave my house to shift to Delhi for treatment. I wasn‚Äôt in control,‚Äù he fumes.The birth of a startupRahul started Yoddhas in 2014 to create a platform for the kind of support and community empowerment that he missed the most during his own recovery. When it came to naming his startup, he went with ‚ÄòYoddhas‚Äô. ‚Äú'Yoddhas' is a Hindi word for 'warriors'. That is how I perceive myself and all those fighting cancer. I chose a Hindi word for obvious reasons-we are focusing on building a support group with special focus on Indians fighting cancer,‚Äù he explains.Yoddhas‚ÄúWe are basically a patient to patient support group. We have various mediums of connecting with each other. For example, various social networking sites like Facebook, Whatapp groups and Website Support forums and even local chapters where people meet in person. These are a few ways we connect with each other. People post their fears, questions and progress on fighting the disease. This way we support each other emotionally and share personal experiences and information.Through the group eventually people personally connect on the phone and call/text each other. We are a dynamic group where we constantly collect information that a patient provides and give it back to the group in a structured manner. For instance, which are the best hospitals for treating cancer and then help a new patient make the right choice using this information. But I would like to mention that we do not have any commercial tie ups with any hospitals or pharmaceutical companies and the patient data and privacy is always maintained that way,‚Äù emphasises Rahul.He continues, ‚ÄúWe hold campaigns in colleges and on social media to get people's attention on cancer and make them more aware about its causes and impact. We also have various on-site campaigns to raise awareness. For example, The Mumbai Marathon on 18th Jan 2015 and World Cancer Day on 4th Feb 2015.‚ÄùFighting the good fightRahul‚Äôs own battle with cancer was a storm of struggle. He says, ‚ÄúIt started with a Big bang ‚Äì the diagnosis. It was like being hit by a 300 km / hour train. Then what followed was even worse. Endless waits at the hospitals. It became my home for the next 1 year. I have had 15 cycles of chemotherapies (1 Cycle = 1 month of doses) and numerous surgeries including removal of my Gall Bladder and tooth etc., all because of the strong chemo‚Äôs that the body could not handle and not to forget countless side effects and running to the Emergency Room in the middle of the nights. After all this, finally a ‚ÄòBone Marrow Transplant‚Äô.All in All a nice roller coaster ride. But a ride that has made me a better human and a more humble person. Today I am in a much better place and have just successfully completed Day 100 post my transplant on the 14th Feb 2015. A major milestone.Launching a startup in the midst of this storm might seem foolhardy to many, but for Rahul it saved his life. ‚ÄúReceiving so much support and positivity gave me strength and inspiration to fight my own battle harder. When I see all these people battling their cancers, in turn I feel great about being able to give other people the same support and inspiration.Also to be able to run something of your own and see your idea become a reality ‚Äì It‚Äôs priceless,‚Äù he exudes.Nitty grittiesThe warm support and appreciation that Yoddhas has received from world over has been tremendously encouraging for Rahul. He says, ‚ÄúI believe it was a simple gap that we have filled. People have been very supportive towards us. One major milestone would certainly have to be the recognition we received from UNESCO. Perhaps Yoddhas would not be where it is today had we not received that extra boost from the UNESCO win. It was basically a recognition among 800 Social Start-ups globally and we won the overall 2nd Prize and also the ‚ÄòMost Popular Choice Award‚Äô. I and my wife were invited to Berlin to receive the award representing India. The discussions and guidance provided by the various experts in the Social Entrepreneurship field really helped me shape our venture further.‚ÄùRahul is now keen to take his venture forward: ‚ÄúWe are trying to work on Bone Marrow Registries and would like to take that to the next level in India. India has less than 1,00,000 registered donors and lot of people are losing their lives because they are not able to find a matching donor. Also we would continue to work on the supporting the patients in various formats. We also intend to be able to make the rehabilitation of the patients easier. Both from getting a job to even finding a life partner.‚ÄùYoddhas also has an international tie up with IMF (International Myeloma Foundation)Currently Yoddhas is financed by Rahul‚Äôs personal savings and various crowd funding campaigns that the team has run. They are looking to scale up presently and need funders for that.Yoddha runs on an army of foot soldiers. Rahul says, ‚ÄúWe have a team of young enthusiastic supporters who work with us at various levels. We have team of 30 plus supporters working from various parts of the country. Our National Coordinator Shivani Naik and Delhi coordinator Hitesh Mandla really run the show at the ground level. Some other core members being ‚Äì Pranay, Palak, Aditi.¬† We also have a lot of voluntary supporters who work pro-bono for us.We have a dedicated group of enthusiastic young volunteers from across the country who are helping us.‚ÄùThe Making of a warriorLike most cancer survivors, overcoming adversity has been the defining moment of Rahul‚Äôs life. He says, ‚ÄúI think adversity really makes you think about the world and people. It makes you explore places within that you didn't know existed or hadn't really bothered considering. Life really is unpredictable. One must take each twist and turn as a lesson and learn from it-you simply cannot drown in self-pity. I love the quote and I have changed it to my liking and in fact it has now become my life‚Äôs motto.If Life gives to lemons,Forget making Lemonades,¬†Make a yummy Lemon Souffl√© insteadThe journey was, of course, not an easy one to traverse. He says, ‚ÄúMy wife and family are definitely major sources of positivity and support. There was a period of grief and depression that I went through. For a while I went into myself and sort of blocked the rest of the world out. I think that was the worst of it. Slowly I realized that there were probably a lot of people out there who felt the same way I did. I wondered- why not bring all of us together to support each other instead of drowning ourselves in misery? So I started working on Yoddhas. It gives me such joy to be able to connect with other patients and see them connect with each other through Yoddhas.Commenting on challenges, he says, ‚ÄúI think the biggest challenge of running a startup (social or commercial) is the germination period. It‚Äôs like sowing a seed and watering it for days and seeing no results. One gets disheartened to see no visual, monetary or otherwise, results. But then one has to have a little faith and be consistent and just continue working towards your goal. You will see results soon. If I can achieve so much with a handicap (stupid cancer) then anyone can be a successful entrepreneur.‚ÄùThe way forward‚ÄúWe have just registered our social startup as a NGO- Trust. So we all are very excited to have finally reached a legal status and now want to further expand to smaller cities,‚Äù says Rahul. And from where he is standing, the future looks full of possibilities. ‚ÄúThe future is definitely bright. We have more and more people reaching out to us for help and this motivates us to progress further. We have ties with various IITs, IIMs, Symbiosis, and various colleges/universities across the nation.‚ÄùSome adviceFor someone who has had enormous amount of growing up to do in the past two years, battling cancer, becoming an entrepreneur and whatnot, Rahul‚Äôs advice to fellow aspirants is deceptively simple: ‚ÄúI would just tell you to get moving. There is no better time than now. Just take the plunge.‚ÄùWebsite: Yoddhas
